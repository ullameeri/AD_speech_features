oh very much so yes um these two branches of thought has such different and such different styles and I feel very uh strongly that one should keep them apart from each other I mean that is the rectified ones writing philosophy ones writing something which is very much more like science in a way than it's than it's like literature and um literature of course has its own rules and its own tricks and philosophy aims to to clarify in fact it's essential to philosophy that should be in some sense clarification and um literature is very often mystification and um besides literature is for fun literature entertains literature does many many things and philosophy does one thing yes well I I hope this is so yes uh I mean if obviously one has a style as a writer and uh I have I certainly have a probably recognizable style as a novelist but my philosophical style would be something totally different and I would be very pleased if it was impossible to tell it was the same person writing yes certainly and um philosophy is to do with getting hold of a problem and holding onto it relentlessly and doggedly and this is the mark of a philosophical mind this particular relentlessness the fact that you stick to your problem well um I don't think one can offer exactly definition of literature nor nor is it necessary in in place here um we know we know what literature is it’s it’s uh it's an art form using words and they I would say that literature is art by definition on the point at which I mean one could define it by contrasting it would say journalism or something I dare say great journalism is literature but there are all sorts of border lines here um and literature is very very various in one thing that strikes one of course is that philosophy is very tiny if you think of small European philosophy is and we yes I mean there’s um it's not a it's not a vast in multifarious area uh what strikes one very much I think is is the way in which the problems which was stated the beginning are still there which some people might forgot as a proof of of yourself making much progress I think the more one studies Plato the more one sees that this is true that he raised practically every problem and raised it in a very sophisticated way um well literature's is is vast and multifarious and multiform um it's not of course entirely to do with fictions I mean there are kinds of literature which aren’t um aren’t fiction and reflections of old times but um typical literatures where I mean in stories and poems and so on it’s a is is fictional is to do partly with playing rules that uh this is true to some extent exactly and uh I suppose entirely almost entirely perhaps one should say true of of the novel that it's to do with with masks and roles and pretending uh and imagining in in that sense um and storytelling and in this sense I think um literature’s very natural it's very close to ordinary life and it's um we all tell stories yes I think this is the most natural thing of the world telling stories everyone um is doing it all the time possibly without noticing it if one describes one’s one's day is it where one is shaping one's material into a story form very often it's a funny story instantly I think is very important fact it's not no there are witticisms yes but not exactly jokes yeah I think jokes would be out of place um and uh that somehow we li- we live in a literary atmosphere I mean we we live and breathe literature to some extent in in that we when we tell stories or when we write letters and so on we are making a form um out of something which might be formless and this is one of the course the deep motives uh for literature or for art of any sort uh that one is defeating the formlessness of the world yes one is cheering oneself up and solely oneself um um and also of course instructing oneself by giving a form to something which is perhaps alarmingly formless in its original condition a sort of rubble as if we lived in a kind of rubble world and one's always making forms no um I think it may be that philosophy also cheers as up of course because philosophy is the imposition of form on the on the formless in a um in a vast way uh but um I think this is something which insofar as the philosopher might be aware of this it's something that he would be suspicious of in in himself because the one’s temptation to produce a um a hasty form or an in- inappropriate form in order to consider oneself this this temptation is one that the Philosopher of course has to avoid and I think the good philosophers always um um so on doing his own work he's this is part of they holding onto the problem being dogged and relentless which would also of course militate against uh certain kinds of literary devices because it means that one has to repeat oneself that philosophy is is repetitive it's coming back over the same ground and breaking the form that you've made and uh yes I think it is a very kind natural a very unnatural activity and when one starts doing philosophy I mean what I noticed this of course in in teaching philosophy that people are very reluctant to play this game or cannot see how it's done at all to begin with because it involves um a very odd sort of standpoint it's it's notoriously difficult to find philosophy of course for somebody who doesn't know what what this activity is it's very difficult to say what it is um it's to do with um with conceptual structures to do with very deep um structures of belief and knowledge to do with meaning significance is partly of course to do with words and the sense that it’s about how language relates the world and and that sort of thing um and it's not science and it's not art and it's it's very important it's not science I think don't you think I mean that that um as soon as you start doing science you're falling right out of philosophy it it's a kind of point of view which uh although this style may be scientific the actual what you're doing is is certainly not science it's a kind of a reflection on concept yes and it means looking at things which one takes for granted and suddenly seeing that they're very very odd indeed yes of course literature is various in this respect isn't it that um some people have a distinctive style other people don't um I suppose it is self-expression in a way by definition I mean that unless you wanted to um express yourself uh you'd uh I mean if you didn't have this motive you would lack a very important motive to towards this form of art um whereas philosophy is certainly not self-expression and philosophy of course is argument uh and uh you could say well is the conclusion true or is the argument valid um yes a philosophy um philosophy is the history of philosophy and since that um there there is a a development in the in the problems and philosophy lives on philosophy a very much more than art lives on art yes I mean literature could be said to be a sort of disciplined um um technique for arousing certain emotions that's certainly one of its um one of the reasons if I one enjoys it uh and and uh one uh one of the reasons perhaps why it it's uh both uh good for us when it’s good and bad for us when it’s bad yes um I certainly hold a particular view on the subject of what art is like my literature is like and and uh this view which wouldn't be shared by um everybody many means um would assimilate um philosophy and and literature just in that way that is I think that there this may be per- perhaps the only important thing they have in common but is it that they're both connected with truth that they are truth seeking truth revealing activities in some sense and they're both uh I mean it's always illuminating in a particular uh uh thought form to say well how is it criticized what kind of critical vocabulary is directed against it and I I think that the question of truthfulness comes into criticism of literature as well as criticism of philosophy um well that um if one thinks of the kinds of things that we say uh about uh uh literature from critical point of view we often condemn it uh for being sentimental or um for being um fantastic in a bad sense uh I mean let's establish their contrast between imagination and fantasy with imagination being thought of as a as a good creative um power and fantasy as um a sort of private self-conservation so that fantasy is bad imagination is good uh I think both philosopher and writer uh have to face a conflict between imagination and fantasy on themselves but of course philosophy is a bit imaginative activity and if one thinks of the of the great philosophers there um may often picture makers are people who produce enormous metaphors and and pictures to explain things um and the intrusion of personal any kind of personal fantasy is obviously out of place there and but e- I think it's an even greater uh conflict for the writer because creative imagination and personal fantasy are awfully close in relation to fiction I mean it the obvious sort of example is the case of the of the novel which um bad novel which turns out to be a simply a fantasy of how the hero who's the writer um tramps over all his enemies and um is loved by the girls and so on yes and becomes rich and uh so forth um and this kind of fantasy is a is a menace to the creative imagination and in condemning art uh for um being fantastic in the sense it once very close to saying that it's untrue that it's saying something which which isn't true um well the philosopher is dealing with truth in a kind of um positive sense in that he’s trying to establish he's trying to solve several problems f- finally whether he ever does is there not the question but I think there are certain philosophical problems which think about perception which perhaps have been solved um um the writer has a whole lot of aims I mean he he this is what of course makes art so interesting that it satisfies a great many uh human activities and instincts it it it um um produces happiness and their creator and in the clanned uh through doing a whole lot of things at the same time but one of the things that does and this is I think is is um is important and comes up in philosophical theories about art which perhaps we might consider in a minute uh there there is I think um a memetic aspect that is that it it is imitation of nature in some sense uh that um literature is about the world um this might seem to be obvious but of course it isn't obvious and since a lot of people would challenge this remark and say that that um literary art is not memetic uh the same kind of question of course can be asked about painting uh music is an is an old man out I think in this particular discussion but I think there are many parallels between painting and literature and uh these are sometimes illuminating we'll see something more clearly perhaps in the case of painting which you then can transfer as it were to the case of literature um I well I find Plato's very interesting because I I it raises all those subjects which one wants to clarify and what's mind about if one wants to defend art I I don't know I think philosophers haven't written very well or not on the whole partly because they very often um put it in as a minor issue they they've got a general view say of moral also metaphysics and so on and they they put in their view of art as a kind of um piece that’s got to be fitted into the picture and they don't perhaps consider it too too seriously or too generously or not generously enough um yes yes this is this is perfectly true yes I I I agree with you oh yes I think that I mean I think that Kant is is very interested in art I think his distinction between a sublime and beautiful beautiful is purely formal the sublime is to do with uh uh kind of moral appeal to the emotions which uh actually he didn't think of as being art at all but that that distinction I think in itself is very informative but uh on the whole um philosophers have tended to be polemical about art and I they’re rather fruitless way I mean they've tended to produce and of course any discussion about our art endlessly to produce again and again a certain sort of either/ors about art that arts got to be one thing or the other yes yes I think this fortunately artists don't pay too much attention to philosophers they just carry carry on but um I think philosophy can be damaging to art in the sense if I think it um the people it damages of course I'm students who long to have theories I mean one sees this very often but they uh young people long to feel that art too can be explained or that the aim of art can be explained I mean there's these it's very familiar sorts of fights um or either/ors that should art be for art's sake or should it be for society's sake and this I mean this is is quite interesting too because again if one one's instincts are to reject this choice which mine or than to say exactly why it can be quite informative well I think it'll better keep out on on the whole um I think that uh people see these things about writers like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in order to have something interesting to say about them as well I mean uh obviously um writers are influenced by the climate of ideas uh of their time and and that they are likely it to be educated people who know a little bit about uh philosophical change and so forth um but the amount of philosophy they succeed in expressing the book is very smaller and I think as soon as philosophy gets into a novel welcome to church it ceases to be philosophy it becomes something else it becomes a placing of the of the writer and and quite rightly um I mean a pure novel of ideas I mean I I I don't know that it it's you know it's very likely that it will uh the the heart of the um writer uh works to present his ideas unless good his work of art is likely to come a very dangerous activity I think that again you see the great 19th century uh writers get away with a quite a lot of idea play in their writings but if you look at it you you couldn't possibly regard it as philosophy it's it’s idea play um yes all right this I just I mean I perhaps it’s just today I feel in myself such an epidural of putting theories as such into into a book I mean certain philosophical ideas might I mean I perhaps put things about philosophy into my novels because I happen to know about philosophy I mean if I knew about sailing ships I'd put sailing ships in if I knew about hospitals I'd put hospitals in and in a way as a novelist I'd rather know but I'd rather know about sailing ships and hospitals than about philosophy but um I don't think that the I mean the writer necessarily um knows well I think I mean I I Tolstoy says this but I I don't know why should we attend to him we read his his books you know of of you know don't trust the writer trust the tale one has to see what what he's actually achieved and um um I think that I mean I can only think of one really good philosophical novel uh uh which is South Llano say which I do admire very much which might be said to be a philosophic novel which is demonstrating something um about contingency its interestingly it's it's um it's a philosophical subject which is very close to the novelist art I mean there's a kind of a good marriage there as it were between the novelist art and they and the the and the subject yes yes um you seem to be driving me to say something  I don’t want to say yes I mean um uh this is perhaps just a matter of degree obviously there are um things to do with the ideas current at the time climate of ideas and so on which um uh give a certain flavor to novels written at a certain time and incidentally which make it possible to write in one way at one time and impossible to write in that in that way at at another time but um I think once speaking roles let’s see I think essentialism may be a something of a special case here because it it is a rather literary philosophy um it emphasizes all sorts of things
