well it it won't be easy I do recall that day with great clarity and all but all of it the coming to the White House first the being taken down to the scene and then appearing before those thousands and thousands of people stretched out on the mall and and um was a kind of an unreality about all of it but uh it was an awareness of uh what it meant in my life and I mean an awareness of the importance of the occasion and at the same time uh a great prayer in my mind that I could meet the responsibilities well yes the country was in the economic doldrums that double-digit inflation uh great unemployment uh the economy stagnating the people in the country seemed was lost uh kind of a belief in themselves and in the country uh also there was the matter of national security uh on any given day half of our military planes couldn't take off for lack of spare parts half of our naval vessels couldn't leave port for that or lack of crew so I'd been determined that we had to restore the economy and I'd been asked many times in campaigning if I ran into the deficit problem because we'd been running uh def- would been deficit spending for almost a half a century with only a few years scattered here and there where where there wasn't an annual deficit and I would be asked questions about well what would I do about national security and the spending for that in the face of a deficit and I said there I would have to choose national security and so we set out to um restore the economy I had some definite ideas on that uh one of them was uh a very controversial one and that is that having a degree in economics I believed and from experience in our own history that the best way to increase government revenues was to cut the taxes not spend them to restore incentive and we had a wide range of tax rate cuts and it worked there was a sizable increase in our revenues as those tax cuts took effect and there still is today so it was to get that done and then the other in I had always believed that there was a a kind of a hunger for a spiritual revival if you could call it that in our country not only a a revival in those things of morality and family and so forth but in our nation as a whole and we set out to do that and uh I hear a great many people who say that uh they have now a restored belief in our country well no I think there's something you have to remember about America this is the melting pot all of us by our way of ourselves or our ancestors our immediate parents came to this country from someplace else and you don't quit loving your mother because you've taken a wife all of us still have a feeling of attachment to uh our original sources and so I don't I I think that still is a part of our makeup and it doesn't mean that we're denigrating what is happening anyplace else it just uh means that we want to live up to the heritage that's been given us well all of those things that we had to deal with there and I know I haven't explained them very well to you of all the facets of it uh the signs we are in the 65th month of a sustained economic expansion and that is the longest period of expansion in our nation's history there is a thing in our country called the potential employment pool all of those people that if they did or wanted a job are available for work the highest percentage of that pool is employed today and has ever been true in our nation's history so I think that uh never mind a a stock slump or something in the market I learned in economics that there's nothing so timid as a million dollars so uh that isn't a valuable or a valid sign and I think that all the signs are there from employment and the fact that we have uh gotten inflation under control down from the double-digit figure that it was and so I believe that our economy is on a sound basis well we have a program of trying to restore competitiveness because our standard of living as you know is so high that uh that rates for production here cost of production is higher than in a great many countries now that isn't something we're not going to do away with our standard of living uh in order to to bring up a be more competitive all we ask is a fair playing field with other nations but I would like to point out that in this broad nation of ours average figures for the nation of course do not apply to every sector there are going to be pockets of unemployment where let's say a plant uh and a manufacturing plant closed because there's no longer a market for its product I think back to some earlier days of what happened and the companies that made buggy whips uh when the automobile came along they had to find new jobs someplace and uh this is true there aren't signs of actual economic uh decline nationwide there are areas where they were concentrated around a particular industry and uh that industry has changed in some instances it's changed because of technology that they find that they can produce uh with the development of manner of of machines and so forth they can they've developed aware of they don't require as many employees but we have a as a result of that a mobile society the people are accustomed in this country to leaving and going to other areas and uh you will find areas in this country where they're begging for employees uh right now in the nation's capital here last Sunday the local papers help wanted ads those are those ads I don't know whether you do it in England but with hundreds of advertisements on one page seventy-four full pages last Sunday employers looking for for employees well I think that anyone who is faced with need and through no fault of his own or her own uh yes government can play a part in helping them my criticism and one of the things that we sought to change and are still seeking to get changed in the nature of welfare reform is that it's one thing to help someone to once again become self-sustaining but it's another thing when the government then introduces a welfare program that actually uh preserves the jobs for the bureaucrats and makes uh the dependence of that individual permanent rather than seeking to bring them out of that to where they can earn their own livelihood well I'm just as critical of it as I was before I got here uh I knew of course the budget by that time was a trillion dollars and I knew that there was no way that you could ba- balance the budget in one year without pulling the rug out from under any number of institutions but I said that we must set out to get us on a downward path to where we could look ahead and see a a date certain that we would be balanced and at that point also I advocated an amendment to our Constitution that would make permanent the necessity of a balanced budget but the budget had been getting out of control for a number of years as I said earlier we hadn't been balancing it for more than half a century now what happened back about 15 years before 1980 the middle 60s President Johnson's administration adopted a program called a war on poverty and it was a great program of government programs help and so forth one kind or another poverty won in that war because beginning in nineteen-fifty sixty-five to nineteen eighty in those fifteen years the budget of the United States government multiplied to almost five times what it had been the budget deficit multiplied to 52 times what had had been so the when we came here it was it was uh built in to the structure and it has just kept on doing this and our fight uh with the legislature in all these years has been to continue working that the cuts that would bring this down to the day in which we could balance it yes there are some frustrations and I don't know whether it's one party alone there has always been a kind of a a contest there and you can go back over the years and see where Congress has sought to restrain some of the constitutional powers of the President and that is continued and uh there are some areas in in which they have restricted the president and um restricted him in such a way that I think it is it uh acts against the best interest of the country well uh and we've more or less held our own there may be some things here or there where they have increased uh their attempt of control but uh the fight goes on no I have always felt that there should be negotiation I've always felt that uh that that was the answer not an eventual war as so many people I think have built into their thinking that it's inevitable someday that kind of contest but you have to remember when I first came here in the first few years I was here the Soviet leaders kept dying on me uh uh I met with some but not in the sense that if we've met now well with this present leader uh yes we we will be uh having the fourth summit when I when I go to Moscow but I came here with a belief that what was needed was realism and strength the realism meaning don't be lured into a daton because it sounds good or to make a treaty in which you shake hands and yet you know that the evils are still going on realism was to make evident that I had a clear view of what the differences were strength was in the building up of our defence structure and some things such as when I came here they had levelled or aimed at Europe and the great targets of Europe the intermediate range nuclear missiles there was no counter weapon in Europe against that the NATO nations had asked this country prior to my arrival for us to provide a counter weapon and so it fell to me to begin the installation of those the Soviet Union protested about our installing these weapons and I offered an alternative I said look we're willing to not put those weapons in there if you will eliminate yours let's have a 0-0 agreement between us and those weapons well they walked away from the table they wouldn't even discuss it we went ahead and installed the weapons and one day they came back and said they'd like to talk 0-0 with us and I think this was another evidence that uh strength you have to deal from strength I have to because of the many things that they're being done there to their own people not just to other countries where they have sought to influence them and make them uh communist allies but in looking at their own people in denying people the right to to practice religion in uh uh the virtually the taking away of the children uh from the family with regard to its raising and it's uh uh education all of the things that of that kind the the person whose career can be destroyed in the Soviet Union simply if it expresses a desire to emigrate and suddenly he's among the downtrodden and the unemployed the labour camps for political prisoners that are they are just simply because they don't agree with some of the government's policies and uh yes I find that I find that evil I think that they are still violating many of the principles that they agreed to in the Helsinki pact with regard to human rights  I say to them they don't know what they're talking about I have said many times a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought I was very interested to hear the foreign minister of the Soviet Union repeat those words himself not too long ago now the present po- the policy that existed when I came in called the mutual assured de- destruction was a policy based on both of us having enough nuclear weapons that if the other one started a war with nuclear weapons you could retaliate well what kind of a defence is that in a nuclear war how could there be a victor where do they live after those nuclear weapons have exploded all over the country and made it radioactive the people who once lived in Tsernobol still can't go back there to live because of the poison so my feeling is that we start eliminating these nuclear weapons and getting rid of them but I am also very determined that after the present treaty before we proceed any further with such as the tactical battlefield weapons then we must negotiate before we do that we must negotiate a reduction of the conventional weapons down to parity to make sure that one country won't have an advantage over the other because that is the ultimate way to get rid of nuclear weapons to make them obsolete if you have to face shooting them with no knowledge as to whether you can get one through to its target then why go on with these those costly weapons and I asked in the very beginning I'm not a scientist but I had brought in our people and our military leaders and I said is it worthwhile is it possible to look and see if there cannot be developed a defensive weapon there's been one for every other offensive weapon since history began a defensive weapon that could actually intercept those missiles as they came out of their silos on their way they came back to me after talking it all over and said yes they think this is worth investigating we have made great progress now we know that we are on the way to such a defensive program and I have never considered a bargaining chip to give away in return for eliminating a certain number of missiles my thought is that once such a thing is proven practical then we can all take a look at our nuclear weapons and say we don't need these anymore in fact I've told general secretary Gorbachev that if and when is we were able to establish there is such a wep- we know they've been working on such a thing for 15 years longer than us but if we should get it first I'd be willing to share the information with them to hasten on the basis that we all get rid of our nuclear weapons well no it seems perhaps that way when at Reykjavik when we finally found ourselves agreeing completely on the eventual elimination of all of the weapons and then the general secretary put the price on that as our stopping the development of SDI so I came home well we're now back negotiating on a treaty to cut in half the strategic ballistic missiles well I have said itto them I have met with our NATO allies at all of them and made it plain exactly what I see as the goals not for just us but for all of us all of them too and I think they see now they had a I can understand it they'd been led to believe that maybe this nuclear umbrella which was part of the basis for NATO uh was going to be eliminated and leave them facing that gigantic conventional force there and uh I convinced them that no that we had nothing of that kind in mind and that um there would have to be the inclusion of conventional weapons as we went further in any any agreements and I think they are all very satisfied now because uh that is our first line of defence well I think you are conscious of uh of what could happen and you certainly wouldn't want to be presiding when such a thing takes place but um I have always felt and said you were in you aren't you don't become president you are given temporary custody over an institution called the presidency and with that goes some responsibilities and if you were willing to raise your hand and say I do uh so help me God uh the time of inauguration why you have to accept that these are now uh your responsibilities  no I sleep pretty well after I've said my prayers well the Reagan doctrine was based on the recovery of that economic slump that we were in and putting it on a firm basis such as uh the reductions in tax and so forth uh to put doing that it was also based on my belief that one of the great strengths of America is that it is a Federation of sovereign states and our Constitution from the beginning provided certain uh rights and laws that belonged at the state level where they were in charge and over the years again the Congress had passed bills that invaded that right and was taking more and more federal power to where it almost looked as if the federal government was trying to make the states just administrative districts if the federal government so I'd pledged also a return to this federal system and we have been working at that there was also a part of that was as I said earlier this need for the people to once again recognize their responsibilities as citizens because our Constitution is different from most all of those in the rest of the world in that it is not a document in which the government says what the people can do ours says we the people tell you the government what you can do and I wanted to restore all of that so that was part of it including the uh dealing with the nations abroad and seeking to help wherever we could developing nations throughout the world uh to understand democracy and to choose democracy and free enterprise as their as their path it is something that with all of the investigations by the committees and the special investigators and so forth has been completely missed overlooked and distorted we have been trying for a long time behind the scenes to bring about peace between Iran and Iraq we knew that we were not the favourite people of the Homene because of our relationships previous to that with the Shah now we knew also that well let me put it this way it started with this by way of a third country in the Middle East we were informed there were some representatives of Iran not of the government who wanted to make contact with the United States to see if they could not establish a better relationship and they put it on the basis if you remember at that time not too long ago we were hearing every day that the Homene’s days were numbered and that he might not live out the week and these people were representative of one of the factions which are still there within that country as to who's going to be in charge when he is gone this third country recommended them said their credentials were honest so we accepted and we sent some people had to be a covert operation because if they were discovered they'd be executed and after our people had met with them for a time and that we too would like to have that better relationship they made the proposal that they would have more confidence in our people who were meeting with them because there was no one like the Secretary of State or anything of that kind not to have a covert operation you couldn't do that that that would convince them that these people they were talking to we're able to contact the top of government here and represented the top of government and they put out that that if they would sell them literally what amounted to a token force it didn't change any balance between Iran and Iraq of uh those missiles those tow missiles this would reassure them but also it said it would strengthen them in the coming f- uh factionalism about taking over the government of course they would present these to the military not the Revolutionary militia but
