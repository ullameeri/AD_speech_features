it's the only place I've ever lived that I know the date that I moved here and the year and it's really home this is um our the house was intact like it was when I walked through the gates the first time I said this is really amazing yeah I miss this place when I'm working this would be three kids I figure Trio is good for nothing alright I can be the I don't want to be the leader I just want to be in the band of the three kids or musician you know that way they could they could be like the Beatles or somebody right now say who's the old guitar player in the band that's what I’d love he grew up with that with that feel you know it was amazing he was he could keep time long before he could walk it's such a joy to be around them you know to to play with it to go swimming with them being around the kids it’s it makes it a difference in your life I was daddies last son and um it seemed like he kind of took me under his wing I was I've always been his baby boy you know and he always took care of me and he was dad was a a great man and I realized there will be a load of compromising on the road to my horizon but I want to be where the light is shining on me and um not every time I sing it on stage now look at it as the light of God rather than any stage light I guess it was born for the God had this plan for me I have no idea I know I'm not smart enough to get here by myself somebody you know was up there watching over me and said okay now you do this and now you do this and it was just like the salmon that swim up the river eight hundred miles to find where they were born you know I think I'm still swimming upstream I learned to sing I think in the churches so mom always took us to church because we were all breastfed if you wanted your food you went to church with mama the first song
