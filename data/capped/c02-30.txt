well thank you no we haven’t we thought we'd give you first crack at it well we both been doing it really for some time Tanya’s been doing I don't know what nine or ten years you see we're not Delta dog was a hit where even when she was 13 and she kind of grew up with it and I did too so it really it really doesn't bother me Tom well you get the same thing too we did just to be away from it really I know look at Reagan he'd say tonight ain’t got a grey hair it is weird it's it's strange we laugh about it all times like uh who knew that we would end up where we are today and where we're going because really saying about Tanya's is such a pleasure she's got big ears and I meant does she hear harmony no yeah it's like like it’s like if I if if I just start singing the songs you can sing harmony with it and her voices are so close the ranges that the blend it's just it just knocks me out on stages to such a place right before I did studio work you know I guess I was singing harmony with Dean Martin on a lot of things uh uh the Beach Boys Rick Nelson is do the background oh that's right after traveling it's uh it's up to you to you and play guitar you know so you get it from both ends and I did make a lot of money doing studio work uh well uh actually it was my new year's resolution for 68 and I fainted a gentleman minded been out and by the time I get to Phoenix have been out but I didn't want to give up the studio work you know you want to make sure you got something here you know like just like you leave in California you know you got something here so you go there and you in yeah it's not this nice to jump look over the cliff now before you take the leap you know but it that was my new year's resolution not to do any more studio work but just to work on Glen Campbell I was very comfortable in it the Tommy produced
