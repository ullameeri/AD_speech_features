well we're here for Christmas of course because of all the things that go on but then we will go back up for our traditional New Year's Eve yeah it starts over there and then it moves to the left if we're satisfied I had to put Ted I had to put Ted Stevens in his place he tried to make it out of that that was an Alaska bear and I told him no that was a California golden bear she was I don't think there was a policeman or a fireman in Chicago that didn't know her she was once chosen kind of the woman of the year because of her participation in all kinds of things but I’ll if we've got a minute here I will never forget the day that Nancy and I pulled in a morning and a blizzard the night train from New York in discard on the train was part way down from the station and not a redcap in sight and the porters put all the luggage out the whole length the Train and there we were trying to find our luggage and all of this and I looked up and here came her mother arm in arm with two red caps and as she got closer you could hear that she knew them she was saying oh your daughter Ellen uh where is she now in school and so forth and said oh my son and daughter would you mind helping me oh she could be that way yes a little intolerant of people that tried to put on airs no because I think this deal is different than anything that's ever been attempted before in arms negotiations between our two countries for one thing this is the first Russian leader or Soviet leader I should say that has ever expressed a willingness to eliminate weapons they already have but as to whether this changes the military balance you're absolutely right that in conventional weapons tanks artillery and so forth the Soviet Union does have tremendous advantage over the NATO countries and over the United States as a member of NATO but there are still thousands and thousands of nuclear weapons tactical weapons battlefield weapons that can be fired from artillery and so forth that still exist these weapons that are disappearing were weapons that if the Soviet Union used them they wouldn't be hitting military targets they would be hitting the capital cities of all of Europe and when it and if it comes to the point of us negotiating as I hope it does one day on those battlefield tactical weapons then conventional weapons must be negotiated as well there would be no point then in removing those weapons which now do give us a balance in counter their their conventional superiority and leaving them then with that other superiority both would have to be but one uh eliminated and the other brought down to the parity and uh we're not anywhere near facing those yet we're facing the terror weapons first these that we want to eliminate totally and that I asked for that in 1981 and the next step the so called start agreement where we are talking of starting with eliminating 50% of the intercontinental ballistic missiles those are the destabilizing weapons that bring terror to the world those are the weapons that threaten us with mutual destruction if they're ever loosed someone pushes a button and within 30 minutes there is devastation and horror in in our country or if we've done it to them in their country and that would be the next step well I hope that it is going to sail through uh anyway I think that the objections that we're hearing and yes from some of our own you might say allies and own forces there based on a lack of knowledge as to what this treaty contains and particularly are they ignorant of the advances that have been made in verification no treaty before has ever uh been based on as much verification and s- on-site inspection and so forth as this one these are this is what has been holding it up for so long until we finally got over that hurdle and I think that this thing hinges something on the first question also that they think that somehow this is leaving the Soviet Union uh with its uh superiority and conventional weapons and I've just explained that it isn't but uh also I think we have to we have to look at the very fact that we have obtained apparently their agreement to a treaty in which they're destroying four times as many nuclear missiles or warheads as we are well I haven't changed from the time when I made a speech about an evil empire and uh I think I could sum up my my own position on this with the recitation of a very brief uh Russian proverb duviai nu proviai it means trust but verify and there would be no way that I could sign a treaty uh just to be signing a treaty and with my fingers crossed that everything was all right this is why it is hinged on arriving at solid verification measures and their agreement to them and uh I think that in the past there has been a willingness on some to just to look uh on the bright side and accept a treaty so that they could say look we've signed a treaty whether it the treaty worked or whether it benefited us or not and uh there's no way that I could do that and I assure the people now that that will never happen that's why I walked out of Reykjavik in Reykjavik we had come to an agreement on literally total nuclear disarmament except that at the very last minute they said it could only take place if we gave up SDI that's when I came home  the Soviet Union has back through the years he made it plain and certainly declared leader after leader has declared his pledge that they would observe the Marxian concept of expansionism that the future lay in a one world communist state all right we now have a a leader that is uh apparently willing to say or in a way has never made that claim but it's willing to say that uh he's prepared to live uh with other philosophies in other countries but again they say that doesn't mean that we take his word for that and sign a treaty he alone may not be able to deliver on something of that kind will sign a treaty as I've repeatedly said here when we are sure that that treaty is as beneficial to us as it is to them and I would like to call your attention to the fact that 1981 when I proposed the zero option of these intermediate weapons they indignantly walked out of the negotiations and said they wouldn't be back well they came back and as a matter of fact uh they came back and announced a zero zero uh as their own idea now I think that uh I think that some of the people who are objecting the most and just uh refusing even to accede to the idea of ever getting under any understanding whether they realize it or not those people basically down in their deepest thoughts have accepted that war is inevitable and that there must come to be a war between the two superpowers well I think as long as you've got a chance to strive for peace you strive for peace but you don't have peace and surrender and there's no way that we're going to surrender uh no way that we're going to sign a treaty that is not as I say to the benefit of all of us well you you are all of you in reporting my writing about Errol Flynn uh sort of skipped over what the young man had asked me he had uh made it out that you'd all build up mr. Gorbachev to the place that didn't I have some concern about sort of standing up there alongside him and uh uh being uh well he'd be the scene stealer and so forth and that's when I couldn't help but say I I co-starred with Errol Flynn and uh so that's all that that was about but with regard to those poll figures and polls I have to say you have to know what questions are asked and um how they're being asked because our doctor Wirthlin that I think is finally the the finest and on the record uh pollster in the nation has just more recently taken a poll and he found that 56% of the people uh in America support the the treaty and uh SDI and then when they heard his interview and him admitting that they too were working on an SDI that figure went up to 71 percent of the American people want strategic uh initiative defence initiative so well I'm sure that they're going to be a number of people at that dinner who uh have different views from him whether that's the place though for uh what you're suggesting I don't know but I I do know this that we've talked all this time here on Disarmament and virtually this single treaty but that is only one of the four major courses that we're going to be discussing with him as we have on all the other occasions and that is human rights uh one of them and we we have made some some headway there has been an increase a number of the so-called refuseniks who have been allowed to come to this country uh have been requests by us by name in which we have named individuals that have come to our attention and um but we've got to go further what you first uh suggested there we've got to make them see that the full human rights the rights that they agreed to in the Helsinki pact have got to be observed the right of people to live where they want to live and perhaps we can point out in our discussions that uh we're not trying to interfere with their internal workings as they have that's the answer that they've given so many times to us on this particular subject but maybe we could make them see that if their people had more of that glasnost that he's been talking about they wouldn't want to emigrate I'm quite sure that there are people there who love their country but it's the manner in which it is being run that makes them think they have to go someplace else but what for example how much emigration on the basis of religious beliefs would there be if they would simply repeal the restrictions that they've imposed on various religions and admit that people can believe in God and worship God in their own way whatever their denomination might be and as a matter of fact um people who have been there and people who have a reason to know not just tourists have said that there is a growing desire on the part of the Soviet people for the right to worship and uh maybe in all of our meetings maybe we could help him understand that and help him get his glasnost well as I have to say I think these things you shouldn't link these various programs but we will be working just as hard regard to human rights just as hard with regard to the regional things such as getting out of Afghanistan and pointing out that if he means his desire for a better more open relationship between the two countries then these are things that are essential to that and that he can come closer to what he expresses as his desire if he meets us halfway on on these other issues  I ever have to have no way of of knowing that I I have to say this uh uh in his f- in favour of him on this on this um thing that I have felt that had been born and raised within the soviet framework uh I have fairly felt that he he he sincerely believes in that philosophy and uh also believes a lot of the propaganda about the Western world and about our country that it isn't just um um um spouting off about shortcomings here in this country he really believes them that's why I am desirous of having him be able to come to our country he has never been here before to come to our country when it is not a summit but when he would be free to see what there is to see in this country I'm a little frustrated when I think you couldn't take him to see it because then he'd think it was all staged uh because he sincerely believes the shortcomings that he discusses of ours and uh I'm still going to hope the other can take place well I think I'd stop short of that but I'd be very disappointed and uh I just don't think it's going to happen I think that we're going to have a meeting in Moscow and I think there is a reasonably good chance that we will make another uh gigantic step forward in the elimination of nuclear weapons well as I say I've I’ve I have to believe that he believes their own propaganda he grew up with us and hearing this well you must remember that there were other leaders under which this happened he inherited that and those leaders are the ones who had created the puppet government now whether he knows that uh to what extent they did that or not I don't know but um I'm quite sure on the other hand that he he feels comfortable with the idea that if they if they left Afghanistan that there would be a government uh similar to the Eastern Bloc nations in Afghanistan not necessarily a government that was chosen by the people of Afghanistan well on our side our job is to make him see that not only must their troops leave Afghanistan but that the people of Afghanistan just as the people of Nicaragua must have the right to determine the government that they're going to have in those countries and not simply accept the present stooges for the Communist world I don't think we could do anything of that kind because the puppet government that has been less there has a military and uh it would be the same as what I'm arguing about with regard to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua you can't suddenly disarm them and leave them prey to the other government and this is PREY not PRAY that they uh no the people of Afghanistan must be assured of the right of all of them to participate in establishing the government they want and uh that requires more than just getting uh his forces out of there but I think that I think we have to look at one other thing here you spoke of the need for pressure sometimes to get some of the things we want uh the pressure on him is that and on the Soviet Union is that that great military power in some almost eight years has been unable to overpower the freedom fighters there they're fighting and literally even terms and uh it must be quite an embarrassment well not at a time when we already are outweighed by the opposition that would come as part of an agreement if you were coming down to parity so that there would not be anyone with a with a great superiority and uh so no we they would have to come down quite a ways by themselves before or they would reach our level I think if you look at the figures on tanks mechanized warfare artillery pieces uh they outnumber the NATO forces by as much as three times as many weapons in those fields as NATO has that's the question that I don't think anyone should try to answer at a time like this um you've tempt me into remarking something about the iran-contra affair I refuse to believe that accepting a request from individuals not in the government or not government forces of Iran to discuss the possibilities of a future government of Iran having a better relationship with the United States that was a scandal for me to accept that invitation and have some people make contact with them and um so I but that uh I'm the one that told all of you that there was money diverted and I didn't know it until after that leak in a paper in Beirut exposed the meeting we were having we were having a covert operation there because we didn't want to cause the death of the people who had wanted to talk to us  no I think most people would overlook then that the president is really her head of the party of his party whichever party he belongs to and therefore while it is a party choice that must be made as to who a nominee is I was this had to be this way when I was a governor I have to be this way when uh as a as president but I can only tell you that whichever individual the party chooses I will wholeheartedly support them as obviously the best choice for this office uh having viewed the candidates of the other party but um I can say this the vice president I think has been the finest vice president uh my memory in this country he has participated in all the major operations that I I had that belief when I came here and I'd had it when I was a governor with the Lieutenant Governor that isn't it isn't someone just sitting there waiting to see if you get up in the morning uh whether they've got another job he's an executive vice president he's a major part he's one of only two of us that are chosen by all the people in this country for the jobs that we hold and so uh he understands that and uh but I have to remain neutral until the decision is made by the party as to who their nominee will be well Dan George and I not every Thursday now but for several years every Thursday until his campaign got underway we have lunched together just the two of us and we discussed as you can imagine all the things that are going on and so forth and um he does not hesitate when I ask to give me his opinion on something but here again you've tempted me into another direction because again that misunderstanding out of the iran-contra so-called afair that uh missiles to the Ayatollah the people that contacted us from Iran the people we were dealing with if the Ayatollah found out they'd be dead uh before uh before nightfall we weren't doing dealing at all with the Ayatollah uh I think he's as big as Satan as he thinks I am and um so and the the weapons this came as a request from those individuals the thing that if we could do that first of all it would assure them that the people they were dealing with surreptitiously were speaking for the government had some standing here in our in our country and also they if they could provide those to them to the military not to the Revolutionary Guard to the military it would give them the prestige the thing that's been overlooked in all of the examinations was that when all of that was happening virtually every day you and others in the press were commenting on how long the Ayatollah was going to live it sounded as if he wouldn't be around by the next week and there was factionalism rising in Iran as to who then was going to take over well this is what this operation was about these people were an element that wanted to have the kind of government that we once were closely allowed to in Iran and this was why we started doing business with them now when they asked for that token shipment of arms to verify and so forth our credentials we turned around and cited that we didn't go along with governments that supported terrorism they made it pretty plain they didn't support terrorism either and we then or I said well alright let them prove their good faith if we do this in using whatever influence they have to see if they could get those terrorists to release our hostages never at any time did we view this as trading weapons for hostages because we weren't doing anything for the kidnappers and we uh but we knew someone that evidently might have an open an an ability to open the door and they
