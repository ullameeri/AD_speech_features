well I think uh anytime you win your first ever Eastern Conference championship and then you're able to uh go on and end up in the fifth game of the finals uh you're continually thinking back to that was a wonderful time for our team is a great time for our fans uh but I think we're at a point now where you you know it's a fun memory and now we're focused on 2010 you know how do we get better how do we repeat as Eastern Conference champions how do we go back to the finals um and this time win a championship and I think you know the uh everybody is going to be better with Sacramento uh contracting and those players going to other teams uh it's going to create it even more parity in the league so we're really focusing on the draft we're focusing on free agents uh we're focusing on keeping our core group together uh I think we had a great uh uh group of players good chemistry on and off the court uh so we want to make sure we keep this group together and maybe tweak it just a little bit and get just a little bit better but I think we need to improve our field goal shooting percentage I thought one of the things that uh that we did good at times was shot really well from the three-point line but I think consistently all of our perimeter players and our four player you know we're not asking our center to shoot threes but we're asking our one two three and four players uh to be very good three-point shooters and I think that's an area that we can improve on and I think if we do uh across the board a couple of percentage points uh you know we can win four or five more games you know I'm a huge Briann January fan I thought we got the steal of the draft and we were able to get her with the sixth pick um she just did a super job for us off the bench played quality minutes and not only did she played the point for us she played the uh the two guard and so there were times when we had Tolly and Brie in there together and I think that her versatility the fact that she is a combo guard makes her even more valuable uh we're excited about the fact that she's over in Turkey now playing really well I think she maybe had 24 points and a gob of assists the other night and getting some more experiences over there I think that she continues to grow our game um it's you know it's just only going to help our team you know she's a push guard she's an attacking guard she can get to the rim she can you know draw and kick and and then I think she's got to continue to work on her 3-point shot well I think it was tough and also a surprise any time you've got a a team that's won as many championships as they had the you know the tradition they had developed there it was was kind of a stunner but I think we all know that everyone in all walks of life is dealing with tough economic times uh I think we were just fortunate that a uh an owners group in Tulsa was willing to purchase them and now that team is moved to to Tulsa Oklahoma and I think that team that team in that city um are really going to rally around um the WNBA franchise being there um so um you know it's it changes the East it changes the dynamics in the east and they were a great rivalry for us and now we've got to uh refocus here and s- you know and is our great is our number one Ron where we going to be Connecticut is it going to be Washington is it going to be Atlanta I'm not sure well there's mixed um mixed feelings about this draft some people think it's you know there's three really great players in the draft and it really drops off um I think for us having the 11th pick um you know we've got to do our homework we've got to really research some
