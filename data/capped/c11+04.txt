um I'm in Sydney Australia right now so and it's a a night time now here now so yeah well if I think back to the time we it's funny we we made that album uh a lot of uh the the songs on that album came from uh we we we had been in America in the U.S and we've been in uh in a actually Miami in a rehearsal room and uh I think probably in this may sound strange strange but uh we went in on a like a Friday and uh and we had been there like a couple of weeks but like uh one weekend we we actually we had not really done weekends we kind of worked for the week and said okay we'll take Saturday and Sunday off and uh but this time we actually said we'll go in on the weekend and uh we went on Friday and came out Monday and we had all the songs ready to go yeah so and the and the only other I think the two other ideas that we had uh um before that that we had worked on really was only two of the tracks one was Highway to Hell we had that one together early and uh and the other one was um Girls Got Rhythm those two tracks we we'd had in in the first couple of weeks but it was that weekend when we we ended up uh you know Friday and it into the to the Monday and we came out with uh all of the tracks that you got you know so you know all in all uh from that point on and uh we had actually been working with with uh there was another guy we've been working with but that's the reason why we went on on really in a weekend we went into work because you know we weren't really functioning with him so we decided we'd go in on the weekend and uh work on our own and put it together and uh and then we uh we were lucky you know uh  well it's probably because you know at that time you know we were really you know we were abandoned you know we went from one thing to the next so quick you you know you would you were touring and the next minute you know you were going okay we gotta do it do an album we've got
