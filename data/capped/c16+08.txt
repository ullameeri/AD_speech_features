well it's sweet and it's not bittersweet because this is something I've thought about retiring for the last three years we just wanted to make sure that everything was in order and and ready for the transition for Stephanie to be ready and so I've been looking forward to uh it's time for me to step aside hand the rein reins over to her make sure she's ready and she is ready and then I can start focusing on the things that I want to do next 44 years of coaching is plenty I've got some other things I want to do some consulting I want a ment- mentor college coaches help them get better um I've got some um social causes that I want to get involved in more I'm going to get a woman elected president in 2016 I'm very passionate about that I'm passionate about equal pay for equal work um I'm passionate about anything that improves the lives of women um whether it's violence on campuses or whatever LGBT rights those things really matter to me and I intend to use my position as a coach is a platform um to make a difference oh it was wonderful it was a beautiful beautiful ceremony in Knoxville Tennessee where I got my master's degree my family was there my friends were there uh it was just an overwhelming moment for me and especially to join the likes of Pat Summitt and Margaret Wade and KO and Billy Mow who are already in the Hall of Fame it was it was wow it was a wow well you know we we have a set of core values you know who we are we're going to play hard you may beat us but you're not gonna outwork us and I think that's the kind of players that we've brought into this franchise and year after year we not only compete with you on the court but we give back in the community that's who we are that's what we value and so that's been important to me I think winning the championship will always be one of the top three moments in my coaching career and then of course going to the White House and given I'll Obama high five that's right up there too I love that well Tamika Catchings sets the tone for who we are she's the face of our franchise and if you want to play for the Indiana Fever you better be willing to follow Catching’s lead she's going to play hard all the time she's relentless in her pursuit uh of excellence on and off the court she sets the standard uh nobody's going to ever out worker nobody's ever going to add hustler and that's contagious and so when you have a player like that you always have a chance to win a championship I’m great how are y’all doing well we've got about 40 or 50 people from West Tennessee Martin and Brandson and uh so it's exciting uh time to have all this crew up here I know some of them came in last night to see the fireworks so that was really neat for them well uh you know we've just been uh trying to get as well uh as good as we could do until we got Catching back and she's slowly but surely recovering from her back injury today will be the first day that she'll play a few minutes uh we had to limit her minutes but that's progress for us you know I give the uh other players a lot of credit we got six new players that they're learning the system and they're just holding down the ship so we can get her back full speed well I'm going to retire after this year from the side lines but I'm going to stay around as a consultant with the fever for a year help them with the draft uh help mentor the new head coach help them with scouting and then a year from now I'll continue with some consulting Consulting uh college coaches and I guess you could say coaching coaches well I'm always pleased with what Kevin Macmillan does with that team when you’ve won as many OVC championships regular season and tournaments as he has um you know it's great for from UT Martin I just want to make sure we
