no uh you know perfectly well I do not come on the Johnny Carson show and a jogging suit I just came from a mountain man and as soon as I finish I'm gonna eat my sandwich and go back to the theatre and do the evening preview and this is the kind of thing you wear between shows but I'm not putting down that Johnny I wear a tie so we got that all squared away  that was the proposed scenario well I didn't mind that so much but as we were the FBI fellas came and picked me up at the rehearsal down at the almonds and and as we were racing out to the free route to LAX why they handed me a bulletproof vest and and that made me a little nervous but I must say uh yeah they'd song as they said we'd have to point out to you that you in fact may be the target now of course I really did nothing but sit there for six hours while the FBI negotiators talked to the lady on the airplane on the ground at Kennedy well it was nothing I really made no contribution Johnny honest honest to me but I did did give me an opportunity that I think was valuable to me well a little bit but those fellas are very even they know what they're doing and at a time when the FBI has come under a lot of criticism from people
