I love what I do so that's my motivation um my motivation is working with young people and going back to trying to help them be successful I mean I don't have to coach another day in my life I don't have to win another game I don't have anything that I feel like hey I've got to prove this I got to stay in the game and prove this I love working with these young women and helping them strive to be the best they can be I think this team has has the talent I think they have the skills I think they certainly have played the schedule to prepare them um to be on the big stage come April and compete for a national championship you know the margin for error now and women's basketball is very fine on a given night obviously there's teams um particularly when you're in postseason that that can beat you if you're not on top of your game first of all she's multi-dimensional offensively she has a post up game she has a face-up game she can play off the dribble she can dunk the basketball she can block shots defend um with um the likes of a guard so that that allows her to play a lot of positions and a lot of roles for us and how good can Candice Parker be she can be the best to ever play the game go hard go to the paint go inside there you got a chance to do something we haven’t done in a while go undefeated in this conference undefeated in this conference and you do that you make a big statement and you obviously lock up your number one seat which is a goal of ours has been over 40 minutes away all right hopefully not 45 I think when people think of Tennessee they know that they're gonna be a tough team a tough defensive-minded team and a rebounding team and they're a team that's going to attack you I mean we're we're not a team that's going to play pass at basketball we're gonna be aggressive and we're going to be in the attack mode at both ends and I don’t I don’t think they are in as good shape as we are either alright things that have to happen your defence is gotta be better Candice Parker you better deny the middle of the four every time 100% whoever’s up there denies the four the other thing that we have to do is when they take shots they take attested shots and we put our physical presence into them a body on everybody you got it because I mean on the boards right now it’s 24 23 them and we we gotta separate ourselves we gotta flat out separate ourselves we agree with that take care of the basketball your defence your rebounding and then you’ve gotta work work work for better shot we don’t have five people working hard we got something you make it work I don’t care if it’s our trinaliching or we call it a a set play you’ve got a sense of urgency and get where you gotta get and you screen and screen hard alright now what are they doing their calling tick-tacky fast it’s ridiculous but they’re doing it so when if you don’t get the rebound don’t go back and try to get the rebound don’t put your hands on anybody just go back and play great defence alright coaches anything else what have you got stay off the sideline off the sideline yes get somebody in the middle there in that 131 Sid you get in the middle right away leave Candice and Nicky on on the block right you guards are gonna hit it’s yours it just depends on how much it means to you it’s a team that really wants it that has everybody committed to what they have to do and we didn’t have everybody committed in that first half everybody understand that this is a chance of a lifetime you can’t be afraid to go out and compete and do whatever it takes and you have to know did I not say we gotta be competitive right we gotta have communication but we must have composure we didn’t have composure all the time we started playing much more like they were playing
