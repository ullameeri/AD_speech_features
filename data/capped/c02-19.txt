in a late fifties I was in a I was working in KLB Albuquerque New Mexico we’d a show called noon-day roundup it was Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys Faron Young came through came in to the show he obviously didn’t come in because it was the Faron Young show and they went to Armory in Albuquerque and em it was a Faron Young show featuring Elvis Presley em Faron had went on last the first night of the tour and they said from that day on he went out and did his show then he introduced Elvis and I could see why and it was very very dynamic Bob Elvis came out with the three pieces and just floored me you know just him and in the three pieces and base drums and guitar and it was awesome no they’re not doing the old Elvis Elvis was so dynamic then em em just his voice carried everything his e-e it was rhythm his phrasing but yeah I saw him in Vegas too and in fact it was March of 77 and it was right before he died in August of that year God rest his soul and em it wasn’t it wasn’t the same Elvis I saw in em naturally that I saw in fifty six or seven in Albuquerque and em the whole show was different you know it was big-time showbiz with a big band and giving his scarves away but in that it was very pure when I saw him in the late in the late fifties em it was it was awesome Elvis Presley I worked on em Viva Las Vegas soundtrack movie where I’m playing guitar and em he could walk in a studio and you could you could you knew he was in the room even if he if he em even if you didn’t know he came in the door he had that much em charisma that much magnetism it was it was awesome yeah well I don’t think he knew he had it but he was kinda em shy about it you know it’s em Elvis was a shy person a lot of people don’t know that and everything he’d do on stage was never choreographed back then it was all spontaneous I think later on it was more
