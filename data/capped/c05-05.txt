well good morning to you and nice to borrow your audience I was persuaded to write it by my publisher Michael Quarter at Simon and Schuster he said Chuck you gotta do a new book I said I just finished one I'm uh I gotta do I'm gonna do a movie now he said I even got a title for you and he gave me the title to be a man letters I said I can't resist the title it's and it's I had to split it up cuz at the time well Jack still is only five and a half he can read pretty well now but I said I can't write letters to him yet he said I said I'll write part of the chap- each chapter to the general audience that will read it and the end of each chapter to Jack and that worked out it's like acting I just like doing it again it's uh I love being a father to my two children when they were young they're both grown now have their own children of course and the chance to do it again uh with their children is irresistible I uh sons may now oppose but I think I was a good father and I think I'm a good grandfather I certainly enjoyed both roles I suppose it depends on the relationship they have with their parents we had a good relationship no they seem uh uh my son and his wife and Jack
