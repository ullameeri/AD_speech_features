this is a pretty good closure I mean not my old buddy here and and Charles Sappnafell some years ago at an ACSA meeting um said we you ought to come to Ball State one of these times so finally Charles Here I am finally it's been a been a while it's an honor to be here I've been using those those jars all my life you know and and uh it's I guess I start ok turn them down and um are they on I got to turn them on technology pause here now they should go I push both on/off beats PowerPoint anyway right thank you thank you I owe you that that pen and they need to go back to zero thank you well I can I'm good at at libbing because this is I remember one time it may might have been that a CSA meeting where um they dropped my slides on the floor in San Francisco remember that one and uh that was the ultimate travesty and I've learned to cope since then so no problem to talk about architecture for me means talking about um a special realm that I've kind of grown up in like I might practice and it's a realm that that travels through time unbelievably the sky is transformed now and the sky has a signature and it's a cultural artifact look this is looking at my balcony toward the Rio Grande and the mountains beyond and the contrails in the sky describe trajectories of motion and they're like the Santa Fe Trail ruts in some ways but they're there ephemera rather than them in a permanent kind of trace and compared to the trace you see on the right which is a inscription Rock El Morro near Grant's New Mexico this is really a conquistador graffiti you know somebody passed by named what’s his name  Ramon Garza or La Russa passed by in 1709 that written scription inscription is just as fresh as it is if it were done yesterday so there's a timeless quality about the land there and uh the land- landscape apparitions that the luxury refers to talk refers to has has to do with land form becoming architecture maybe where you kind of blur your eyes and uh it's either landscape or it's uh
