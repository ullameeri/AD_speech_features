I think your work deals with uh inner landscapes of landscapes that um they they're subjective and we we all have our own um inner versions of of um translations extrapolations from the um from extant landscape in LA I heard that mr. T bought a house over in Beverly Hills he chain sawed old palm trees down right away and I I think um to talk about um transformation and um in respect and response to respect for in response to an extinct existing landscape I think that was the best Landscape Architecture move I've heard of in LA lately because I think that um LA is a botanical garden of uh you know it's another kind of imagine in your landscape it's nothing to do with with origins very LA basin origins which were about chaparral you know sycamores and washes and um occasional cottonwoods the um so but then it as in your uh eloquent collages I mean your there's it's all up for grabs there's there's a anybody's take is is uh arguable and and and at the same time believable there there's no uh me the datum that that um the non-datum that exists here throws it all out for grabs I think a mr. T should get the ASL award well you should take a a John Cage book along and and I mean it's a I don't know if I said two days it's it's a it's a timeless connection and it can be in a flash or it can be camping out forever I mean it I don't think it has to do with uh physical time spent on site I carry sights around with me on airplanes in my feelings at work on tray tables and airplanes and you know I don't think it's a question of time at all it's a question of intensity and willingness to surrender to place that is actual in place imagined two hours is plenty don't worry about it want to talk about that  um I think the um let's talk about the Venice house the the uh perce- there it's about perceptual influences the uh isolating the prospectival trick or whatever it is is is um artificial because it's really a lot of things at once there there are some subliminal relationships to um
