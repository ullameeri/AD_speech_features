well I have a lot of of questions um I've got notes of them here which I will consult if I may from time to time uh all right I I I and uh I'll just start with one uh that interests me and we'll see where we we go because I there's a lot that I would like to ask uh it's about the word experience which you sometimes use in your writings as uh representing something which you think we should in some sense overcome and you seem to uh connect the idea of experience with the notion of uh preconceived attitudes or dogmas or beliefs uh which uh impede uh a kind of being which you would connect with uh with a creative present existence now I don't entirely understand this uh I it seems to me that it just would be impossible uh entirely to uh to discount or escape from experience but I'd like just a stick to the to the term experience because it's such a very um perhaps there's a very particular sense you want to attach you it's such a very general word it seems to describe the continuity of consciousness which is simply characteristic of being human but perhaps you could say something about that you mean imagining it well this is a rather special sort of experience isn’t it well this is a um um a difficult question about how one is going to use the concept because if the world experience in English it describes something fairly vague it it couldn't mean it could mean either you say I had a strange experience yesterday or it can mean the continuity of your conscious life and your relationship to our past or it can mean something momentary but I I think what you are wanting to mean that is something which collects your past as it were uh and I I at one point I think you described desire as experience whereas love is not experience but could you just explain what the distinction is you say who is who is the experiencer well this is a difficult question true isn't it I mean if one were to ask a passer-by on the street I mean he will say the individual yes these experiences belong to me so they are my experiences but they but then I mean if one were to pursue the matter beyond that kind of answer one might say well of course one must distinguish between different kinds of experience and um one would then think I mean let's say I could think of say three kinds immediately I mean that there's the experience of my past life you say of somebody he's an experienced man meaning he's had a lot of a lot of experiences experience is just the continuity of my consciousness uh going way into the past well then this is to let's pursue the matter then in this way that one would say well my consciousness differs at different times I mean it would be and the word experience I would think would differ whether you are talking about uh just ordinary uh life when say you're as a way imposing let's put it this way that partly you are sort of imposing yourself on the world and you'll say I'm doing this I'm doing that and this would be perhaps experience but also there might be an experience where you won't really present well I would think that people behalf what I'd call selfless experience uh um when they're well for instance when they're um looking at a great work of art um or I'm not sure about whether if they would somebody they love very much one could say this perhaps I think these two cases are very different but what what do you how where would you  well we would normally say say wouldn't we because um one we believe in the continuity of an individual person which of course is a well again we would usually say so because um one uh you could say I order my thoughts I mean I then this assumes that I am deciding to coll- I collect my thoughts we have such a phrase I’m sure well let's make a distinction here between ordinary language where one speaks about I mean in a law court or something somebody's responsible for something they've done even they they can't say well I'm a different person now or something I mean there's an ordinary sense of the continuity of the individual and somebody being the subject uh but leaving that aside uh I mean one doesn't have to be a philosopher or hold a religious view to think that the one is dividend one is a divided being and uh an there’s there are times when one part of you disapproves of another part so well nothing could be more fundamental yes I mean the the the this seems to be the nature of the real world that there is this difference yes this would follow in that if you if you condemn yourself for doing something then you are divided well if if this is an appeal to uh the word experience comes up to it my mind if this is appeal to  how I think about myself uh I would say um leaving aside the common sense or ordinary language view uh sometimes yes and sometimes no I mean that sometimes one is consciously uh judging oneself dividing oneself sometimes there's nothing except a single something rather single being or something yes well it sometimes seems so well I would have thought that it is and it isn't uh there's something uh there’s two two things that you say uh in what I have read and what I understood from our last conversation uh two perhaps I can put it this way there are two things which you seem to me to say which I don't understand how they connect or um are or harmonize I mean one of the things is I think that you uh which I liked very much you said that if I think that I am if I condemn myself if I think if I think well put it this way if I think that I am envious say well now the word envious suggests something which is bad so when one’s not to be envious perhaps uh if I say this I will start not in a kind of ideal self it doesn't exist but in my real being which is the envious person uh I feel great sympathy with this but then you also say that um there's no process I mean that I must be good not become good that the idea of becoming good is in somewhere an illusion now perhaps you could explain I mean it seems to me that in the one case you're suggesting that I must start from a guru which is a long way from my conclusion from my conclusion would be come unenvious the other way you're saying that uh there is no process of becoming  yes well this is what I don’t understand at all but do you you don't uh dispute this I mean you don't reject this go on well I I find though if you're asking me would I agree with that I I I'm not sure I mean I I think that I think we think about good and bad in in several different ways don't we we think of bad grading into good as if it were a spectrum was a goodness is here say a continuum continuum we also think I think if good as being if we think of it as perfection being really outside the world yes well let’s say good man then well yes if some people would say that they're opposites which exist in relation to each other well there's a very different between a bad man and a good man so in that sense they are very different on the other hand in a human being good and bad are gradient to each other and sometimes you don't know which is which I mean in ordinary fallen human conditions of course love often occasions hate but you say love is not related to hate uh you mean that it's an entirely different kind of concept wait a minute let me ask a supplemented question would you say the same about love and desire if we took the tho those two words you would you regard desire as something connected with psychological becoming yes and love is well now how does this different thing uh come to one I mean I might say well why why should it concern me what am I to do this yes you're using the word love in in a ideal sense which is unusual the sort of the psychological being so yes but this comes back to your saying that you don't experience love the way in which you experience desire but if I just I mean if I'm loving I mean uh better day again let's put this aside that in ordinary parlance um you speak of jealous love or something well that’s not what we're talking one's talking about some sort of absoluute or I can't really think of the right word here but then I mean if I say well I I dearly love somebody and some as might one might say not a bad way but a good way as it were would you want to say this is not part of any psychological process in in my mind yes yes right yes I mean this I mean I'm I thought I was a Christian so there's a lot of of Christian way of looking in me although I don't believe in God or the divinity of Christ uh but I can see I mean in Christianity uh there would be an idea of divine love or perfect love which is something which we don't normally achieve at all perhaps but such well it doesn’t mean attachment attachment is is um attachment and desire I mean I think I mean what one would in ordinary power is called virtuous love I mean where you’re not hurting anybody else by loving this person and you're not possessive and unreasonable and so on uh there is attachment I mean there's uh inevitably if the person dies yes I I would I think I would take a different view as a convolution of desire I mean that is I seems to me I I would think that becoming good to use this phrase which perhaps you would want to exclude is a matter of purifying one's desires having good desires that is desiring something which is good now in loving somebody uh I would have felt that the element of desire uh was was present well there again one would say well there are low desires and there are high desire well desire is certainly connected with with the futuure it's connected with time  because I I desire something which is absent uh and I um but I mean let's take examples I mean I might desire to be frightfully rich or I might desire to study a subject and become good at it I mean in a situation where there’s no need well let's say all good at mathematics to acquire acquire knowledge well wouldn't this and I might say I love I love my subject uh I love what I’m studying well transmute yes I I'd rather use the word transmute yes and there's a process of transmuting and discipline or training or something like that yes education desire for riches is bad well uh whether there can be love without desire I'm not I'm not sure uh if one thinks perhaps of some kind of perfect love the notion of desire would have changed so much that perhaps you would have to exclude it but as an ordinary as a more ordinary but good level I mean if I desire to become well educated or something then this is a it's a tension it's a kind of tension between a condition which exists and a condition which does not exist well I I would I think I would they it or rejectthis question because I don't I don't see how one could explain what desire was without thinking of different kinds of desire how do you think and if someone says one is good and the other is bad you would come back to saying all the same it's desire yes I'm not sure that I would be able to understand it without without using that distinction but perhaps I can I mean let's shift our ground slightly um there's something behind what you're saying well all right well I think I’m going to withdraw that now and modify it by saying that I think that they should there might be some kind of desire which does not uh involve time before you are completely united with the object of your desire I mean I think this again would I mean something in Christian mysticism might say that the desire if you if you desire gold and if you're united with God I mean I don't know what this would be uh then uh your desire is fulfilled and becomes perfect love or something like that yes but you speak of desires if it's something but you want to overcome or set aside it’s not always a burden isi t I mean if if you des- if you desire something for instance if you're hungry and you know that you're going to have a good meal shortly then the attention of desire is pleasurable  but um but there’s something behind what you say which I I can’t get go on go on by sensation you don't mean bubbly sensation you don't mean that there’s actual physical concomitant but this is a kind of um imagery I mean you imagine yourself in the house say things like that so yes there is a kind of sensory aspect yes this doesn't mean of course that I mean one says one desires um one desires to be educated this does doesn't mean you're thinking about it all the time or having sensations you’re just means you're carrying on the life but there would be moments when you you have you you have a sensory um um experience of desire perhaps you imagine what it'll be like when your education is better or something like that yes but then you you just you say that love is is different from desire sorry say that again um yes all right uh uh I I would want to think that pure- purified desire uh this sorry this is the this introduces another topic it this one which I've let's just mentioned put it aside I I am also concerned with what you feel about motivationed energy I mean I think that desires a source of energy and good desire as a source of good energy but but let's take this idea of love being different I mean there's something this is seems to me a contrast between a process and something which is not a process yes it’s and you distinguish you say that there's something like you use some word like like creative being which is to do with the present and you would connect this with the possibility of love and truth whereas desires is is something restless which is outside this no ascetic it's probably the wrong Word here what what would you say it it's creative and it’s and it’s but the feeling of love is is a quite different feeling from feeling of desire so you're not excluding the sensory aspect of thought I don’t know you tell me but tell me if if love is a condition it is a human condition I mean it is a there is a state of being which is love or creative being which is love and so a person uh is sometimes in this condition uh are you suggesting that at that moment uh all the psychological stuff which that person consists of and has collected is uh somehow absent but still he must know what the object of his love is yes though I mean in a sense it isn't it isn't it isn't it because one I mean if one loves if one loves the person you love that person and not another one but it doesn't mean that you exclude anybody but still  no but it is selective if one could make the distinction after all we’re not gonna love anybody I I mean um um perhaps God does and perhaps we should attempt to be God but what I mean you’ve just using God as a figure of speech there I mean the an ideal of would perhaps embrace everything but uh I mean to ask very very simple-minded questions I mean in the life uh let's say that you're interested in another person I mean afterall people come to you I mean I’m I’m coming to you yes but I I ask um well do you think there are certain times in one's life when one is uh one’s difficult to find the word well when one one is expressing or being loved but should should this be every moment of one's life in every moment of one’s life yes and you think if you see that no it would be imperfect love but let’s let’s let’s leave out imperfect love is is not love alright you won't let me use the word perfect or ideal but I'll use love in your sense then all right love then it does excludes šelf-interest yes but look then you see something that I very much want to find out uh and everybody wants to find out is how to change how to change how to become well it's connected with this because  how to move out of the situation of being envious yes as we were saying earlier the person is the envious person well yes but you could become less envious
