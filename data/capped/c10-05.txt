well she cor- of course was a major part I had a brother too a couple of years older than I am four in our family the two of us and mother and father and uh she was probably the kindest human being I've ever known now looking back I know that we live in poverty or pretty close to it all the time but we didn't know that at the time because the government didn't come around and tell us we were poor and uh she was always finding someone worse off uh that we would help and I remember that about her uh this kind honest and all and yet at the same time she could be firm like the time in an even smaller town where I was born Tampico Illinois eight hundred people and we lived across a little park from the railroad station and in those days the biggest treat wasn't the ice-cream wagon coming around it was the ice wagon and kids would get chips of ice from them iceman was chipping the pieces out to put in the ice boxes along the way and the ice wagon had pulled up over there and my brother and I saw it and he being the older took the lead and we started across the little park but a train pulled in between us and the ice wagon and my mother came out on the porch just in time to see us get down and crawl under the train to get to the other side and we were barely through and at the ice wagon when the train pulled out she met us in the middle of that little park and uh we felt a very firm hand both of us applied along about midway in our backs oh she yes she was always talking about things like that but making great sense with them but the re- regarding the reading uh I don't know that she was aware that she was teaching but when we were very young and at that point we lived in Galesburg in a rented house there my father was traveling around looking for better jobs and uh she would read to my brother and me when we went to bed she'd get between us on the bed and read the bedtime story but she always did it and holding the book and running her finger under the line she was reading and the two of us were there and we could watch and we could at the same time hear of course now I don't know whether she was doing that deliberately and I have no recollection of ever learning to read but I was one night when I was five years old I was lying on the living room floor with the newspaper and my father came in and he said what are you doing and I said well reading the paper and he thought I was being smart aleck and he said well go ahead read me something and I did and the next thing I knew he was out on the front porch yelling for the neighbours and he brought the neighbours in and made me read for them because there was no kindergarten I had never been anyplace but at home at that time a year away from starting regular school but uh yes I was reading the paper yes I think I can and uh I believe very much in what Abraham Lincoln said when he had this job he said he couldn't perform the functions the duties of this job for fifteen minutes if he didn't know that he could call upon one who was wiser and stronger than all others but in that connection I think my mother a lesson that was hammered over and over again and as I grew up I really began to realize and that is when there was a great disappointment something went wrong she would say to us look just everything happens for a reason and for the best now she said you may feel bad about this right now but down the roads something will happen good and you will in appreciating that look back and say if this if that hadn't happened that supposed bad thing this good thing would not have happened and I had a classic example in my growing up I'd graduated from college in 1932 I was hitchhiking around I'd set my mind on a career in the entertainment world so I thought it starting if I could ever get in and be a sports announcer would be radio was pretty new in those days and uh finally I was disappointed I had had advice to just try to get a job in a station never mind what you wanted to do and then take your chances on moving on from there but I couldn't and a very wise woman in a major station in Chicago told me that I was going out of the wrong way I shouldn't be trying for those big stations where they couldn't afford to hire inexperienced go out there into the smaller stations well I hitchhiked home and arrived and was told that a Montgomery Ward's store had opened in Dixon and they had a sporting goods department and they were looking for someone that was kind of well-known in the town for his high school athletics there and so forth to head up that department well I went down and applied and I didn't get the job fellow a couple of years after me in high school a been quite a basketball sensation he got the job I was pretty disappointed my father loaned me the car I'd told him all the things that I've been doing a family car and I drove 75 miles in my disappointment down to the tri-cities Rock Island and Moline and Davenport Iowa and there in a station in Davenport Iowa I met a program director who he still couldn't use me and uh but where was I because they had just hired an announcer a few days before and I didn't tell him I didn't listen to his station but on the way out talking all to myself really I said how do you ever get to be a sports announcer if he can't get a job in a radio station and went on down the hall and pretty soon I heard a clumping he was very badly crippled with arthritis and had two canes and he was yelling out your big so-and-so wait and he caught up with me the elevator wasn't there yet and he said what was that you said about sports and I said well that's what I'd like to be what he said you know anything about football I said I played it for eight years he said could you tell me about a football game and if I was at home listening the radio make me see it and I said I think so he took me in a studio stood me in front of a microphone and he said now when the red light goes on I'll be in another room listening you start broadcasting an imaginary football game well I stood there waiting for the light and I knew I had to have names and I remembered the year of that previous fall my senior year playing in a game murica when we went 65 yards on the last play for the winning touchdown and it was the last play of the game and I knew all our players names and I knew enough of the opponent's names that I figured I could so I started in the fourth quarter and I had that long blue shadow settling over the field and the real wind coming in through the end of the stadium we didn't have a stadium we had bleachers and uh then I ran a few plays and finally I came up to the big play and I had this and did the big play and made the touchdown with only 20 s- to play with only 20 seconds to go and so forth and then I grabbed the microphone and says that's all he came in and said be here Saturday I'll give you $5.00 and carfare you are broadcasting the Iowa Minnesota game for us I might still be there working in Montgomery Ward's well all the things in between that resulted and this wouldn't have happened oh there are things I think it takes reminders and so far removed in that way of life and this one but there are reminders every once in a while that just like this one that at length I gave you that that you will think back and say hey this maybe had a a beginning there well I was I majored in economics and sociology they were combined so it was a single major but then you were really studying at a time when life was in the raw this was the depths of the depression we had a professor a wonderful called daddy Gray and um he used to give us outside reading books by economists to read then we'd come in with a book report and so forth then we discuss it and I can remember him he had a sense of humour also there we were in the depths of the depression a book by a noted economist and when we'd finished reporting and everything just as the class was concluding he'd say uh it's interesting to note that the author of this book five weeks before the crash said he saw no reason why stock should not continue to rise indefinitely well uh that said you will illustrate but um well no but the the the things I say at that time you were really studying in a classic example of economics and what was going to happen this was prior to the election of of FDR and all of the recessions we've had since no one who didn't go through the through the depression can ever visualize what it was like 26 percent unemployment nationwide the government going on radio with announcements don't leave home looking for a job there are none well there were no government programs at that time to take care of of uh the people that suddenly were just destitute my father from managing a a shoe store with a a kind of work a partnership in the ownership was out the shoe store was gone and this was happening in little towns like Dickson as well as in the great cities the National Guard in Illinois was mobilized and sent to parade in Chicago simply because there were so many people living in doorways on the streets by that time in the streets just off Michigan Boulevard that there was real concern about uh rioting and and so forth and they just did that as a show of strength well there may be some because there are a few spots in the country where due to a change in industry and so forth they principal industries in those communities uh are gone and it's a case of either move or bring a new industry into the community and so forth so there are a few trouble spots but basically as you know 19 million new jobs have been created and uh the largest percentage of those has gone to the people most in need and they are better jobs than ever before and over 90% of them are full-time not part-time jobs so it isn't a situation comparable to that and I think that you have to recognize that some of the people on the street have chosen that because right here in Washington shelters both private and public that have been opened for those people have space in them and people that can go there and won't prefer to be out there on the grates and so forth and uh whatever their reason is just remember that recently in New York a young lady took a case to court to force them under her constitutional right to let her go back and live in that cardboard box out on the street well whether I called it luck or whether I call it an answer to prayers I I realized that I was very blessed and uh that's why I thought that also uh and for those blessings that I kind of uh I ought to pay my way by doing whatever I could and return for others oh well this was in the wonderful era of Hollywood that exists no more the era when the seven major studios all had their list of contract players and stars their directors were under contract the producers and writers it was like a family in the studio and at Warner Brothers there was uh Jimmy Cagney and Pat O'Brien and uh uh Betty Davis and Wayne Morris had just become a young new star there on for kid Galahad that he'd made but uh then Dick Powell and Jack Carson and when you can go along with The uh with the trying to think of them all at the same time but you'd eat there in the commissary at lunch and they were all around you and be at their same table with you and uh it was a a wonderful time but also you uh were made to realize you you were under contract now they took me in and sat me down and it was as if I couldn't hear because they were all talking about me in front of me and they were trying to decide on a name for me I'd always used my kid nicknamed Dutch one as a sports announcer Dutch Reagan and they were talking and talking and uh finally I was getting a little uncomfortable and finally I said to them because that was a pretty big radio station by then I said look uh you know uh my name's rather well-known in a large section of the country and do you think we just uh toss it off and they said Dutch Reagan and I said well my real name is Ronald Reagan I'd never used the Ronald I like Dutch better and uh they said Ronald Ronald Reagan hey that's not bad I got to keep my own name Ronald Reagan oh my goodness the lane sisters had just come on big in pictures Priscilla Lane uh I was in a picture with Betty Davis and it was a wonderful experience she was such a great actress uh and it was Jane Bryant uh oh good lord I'm forgetting some of the names Ann Gerard and Sheridan oh yes he picked it with Ann Sheridan and she was she was a great gal just wonderful I'd rather they didn't make this story if I can't play it I don't know that I want to recommend anyone else the I'll tell you the lack of continued publicity as we had when the fan magazines existed and everything and each studio had a publicity apartment with men that were assigned to a group of performers there to see that their names were constantly before the public that doesn't exist anymore and I find a great difficulty in remembering the names I'll see a face on the screen say oh yeah her members saw them in another picture but uh the names just don't don't linger oh my well if you remember constantly there were uh there were movies that were made uh can't remember titles but movies that were made say about West Point or Annapolis and uh always at that kind that the plot took place in the story with with regard to cadets but were there in the in those schools and then there or of course the service pictures that and when the war came war pictures that uh were built and based on patriotism and so forth and and were pretty factual in their portrayal of those uh of those times uh yes I think there was a great thought in in Hollywood to to make pictures that tied in to the things that people understood and knew oh I think there are any any number you could start with uh our people that go abroad in the in the  or go up into space in the shuttle but you could come back to the heroes of our time and um but I think also it's more general than that that's that I remember as a little kid you knew that when the flag went by you were to stand up put your hand in your heart you knew that you were to stand and sing the national anthem and you learned to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and you also history was required and therefore you knew the beginnings of this country and you knew the names of the the great Patriots and who a George Washington was but but all the others and I don't think that's true today so often well when and I won't name the University don't want to embarrass anyone but when not too long ago uh third-year students juniors in one of our large universities couldn't tell anyone which side in World War two Hitler was on now is there anything wrong with thinking that history not with regard to whether it's going to help you make a living or anything of that kind but that everyone should know the background and the history of their country how it came to be and thus what our citizens responsibilities are isn't it a little shameful that in this country which had to fight for the independence of We the People is now smaller and smaller growing the number of people who bother to vote how does anyone have the nerve to complain about any level of government if they didn't go to the polls Will Rogers once said that people in elected to public office are no better and no worse and the people who send them there but they're all better than those who don't vote at all well again as I say I recognize that uh for whatever reason I have been blessed and uh never a day goes by that I don't say a thanks for that blessing and um also I ask that I be given the wisdom to do something to uh show my my thanks for that that blessing was engaged I honed my fraternity pin on her well yes she was the daughter of the minister of our church and uh I know that she was going to Eureka College and uh it wasn't really that I made the decision then to go there I had already made that when I was much younger my biggest hero happened to be the son of the then minister of the church and he was a great high school football star and as a kid I saw him and thought he was great and he went to your Eureka played football there uh later for a time why I think was uh the chaplain at Yale University but um yes we went together in high school in Eureka College before we got out of college why that was I don't know whether it still exists today but yes engagement you buy rings you put your fraternity pin on her  well I knew that from my own background and so forth I knew that I had to achieve a certain level of income before could contemplate marriage but I think that's the thing that uh that our romance didn't survive she became a schoolteacher and I was way over in Iowa there as a a sports announcer and a long separation there wasn't chance or possibility of visiting uh each other frequently and um then one day I received a notice that she uh was engaged in marrying someone else no and uh a former teacher in high school of mine one that kind of teacher that every student has that you remembered through your life he wrote me a letter he had also seen what had happened and he wrote me a letter telling me uh how I was to react and that I was to do any foolish things like going off the deep end or anything and uh I remembered him but uh again it must have been one of those things that the disappointment that now you look back on and say well if that had happened what what I have now might not have happened that whole thing has been the hardest burden I think of all that I have born here is that idea that I am not as sensitive and that somehow I am discriminating and so forth and it is not true that household I was raised in my mother and father the thing my brother and I grew up knowing was that there was no greater sin than prejudice or discrimination and this
