Ray Charles and um Billie Holiday see I got and I gotta work tomorrow in um Jones Beach 1954 I guess it was Los Angeles with Jeany Odus one is downtown and one is uptown the difference between blues and jazz one is downtown and then those jazz guys took it uptown it’s the same thing well it’s kind of like in um the fifties when rock ’n’ roll there was rhythm and blues and when rock ’n’ roll came along was like it was the same thing it was it was blues then and then and it was pulled from that and now it’s just that everybody’s intensifying the blues and making it really fun
