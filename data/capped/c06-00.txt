I'd wake up in the morning and you know I'd I would I think where am I I well I just uh you know I just I just felt something was different and uh you know I at the time I didn't know what I was dealing with and and till I went to the Mayo Clinic I I couldn't be for sure but I can remember you know you know being trying to to coach and and trying to figure out schemes and whatever and I just it just wasn't coming to me like I typically would say oh here we're gonna do this gonna run that I think it probably caused me to you know second-guess and I know when I was talking with Mickey you know and and I just she said you you know what's what's going on with you and I said I don't know you know I don't know and so you know I was glad that we went to the Mayo Clinic because you know dr. Peterson was great they were all great and at least I knew then you know what what I was dealing with well just for one thing getting up and getting ready to go to the office and you know not sure what time I'm supposed to be there you know um and I think it was you know it for me I was I was trying to figure it out you know and I I think that's why that's why at times you know I I'd stay here as opposed to going in early to work and you know just uh just to be around the house and be in a you know safe place no I just want to know what was going on you know because I mean I could retire but you know right now you know we're we’re trying to get this team where it needs to be and you know you know we've got a veteran group and no I'm looking forward to the season I'm not gonna let this keep me from coaching that's for sure well you know I'm gonna be speaking to them here in the next few days but um you know I think they'll I think they'll respond you know if anything else I think they'll rally and um you know I I think they need to understand what I've been dealing with and can't wait to you know meet them when they all get back in and sit down and tell them what I'm dealing with and it's it's not going to keep me from coaching and if anything it's going to inspire me more and to help them I don't know you know me it's not like I'm gonna go in there with a you know notebook here's what we're gonna do just go and go in there and be myself and tell them what I've dealt with and we're gonna move on and that's that's what I want them to do I don't want to be I don't I don’t there's no pity party and I'll make sure that well he's he's my rock and um you know it's just the two of us and the rest of my families you know in the Clarksville area um so you know I want him the one thing I want him to do is you know he has his own apartment now and once you know this is all out in the open I just want him to go have fun and I was like oh no I have good help I got I had good help all I wanted to do was play ball well when I talked to dr. Peterson he goes I totally understand he was awesome it's great basketball both teams are really playing well you know it's it's a great a great atmosphere and obviously uh the fans here really appreciate the play of both teams well because I I like the way they play basketball here and and they've had a lot of great players and you know we we're trying to find the best players that we can find to to bring to Tennessee well it's my 37th year and I I I don't I don't have any quitting any time soon and I've got a great coaching staff and uh we have the best fans in the country
