thank you it's been great to be a part of the university and a part of this community yeah you know you can tell that I back down from competition and I just thought you might just overwhelm me but you'll have to admit you were relieved when I wouldn’t play you well I think the fact that I grew up on a dairy farm uh actually uh slept uh we had a log cabin was our home and I slept in a baby bed till I was six when I got out of that baby bed I said I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it and the discipline the work ethic uh parents that really taught us valuable life skills uh influenced the direction that I've taken in my life and I just knew them with three older brothers if I could survive that and milking cows every day you know cows don't take a day off hollering uh every now and then we get a day off right not very often but um just um to commit to something and to commit to it every day and I think that's what you see I think you see someone that's gone through that type of life and that's the way I think you live life I think my parents gave me two excellent examples of you can do anything you want to do you can have limited resources and find a way to be successful in life because it's about work and and I knew it's going to be hard they taught me that life's not easy it's difficult it's challenging but it's doable you can do it and they showed me by example and what better examples to have then two people that you love and admire and now more than anything I respect them oh absolutely complained all the time you know my sixteenth birthday party I missed because we had a forecast for rain you know farmers get up early in the morning they watch the ten o'clock news over in uh Middle Tennessee and they they plan their day and um I'd plan to to go to the country club I never got to go to Country Club very much and um we uh there was two of us celebrating the birthday there and I was going to meet up with all my classmates and my dad goes no no we have a thousand bales of straw on the ground you're gonna drive the tractor I remember being so mad Howard and I was oh absolutely not well I just I don't know that I grinned but uh I went forward with what I had to do and that was what I was expected to do I knew that was the exactly no we're going to work we got a job to do and I said yes sir I like my father I love my father I just I liked him um I liked him and and I admired him and and I loved him but he couldn't tell me he loved me and I couldn't tell him I loved him that we just didn't do that we didn't talk about you know I love you uh what you say to your kids and and what I say to Tyler every day but I knew he loved me I knew he loved me sure sure I wanted to hear it and you know it it it took me uh about 30 years to to to hear it but that was okay actually I was 22 years old I had four seniors that were 21 um it was just uh timing it was great timing for me well it wasn't like they're gonna pay me big bucks let’s face it Haward and I went there on a graduate assistantship and uh I I just graduated from UT Martin it asked me to come be the assistant to Margot Hudson who was a head coach a couple weeks later they called back and said uh that Margaret's going to work uh on her doctorate so she's taking a sabbatical and will you take the head job and I I was scared I'll be honest with you I I had no preparation I’d never run a practice never coached a day in my life and I felt like I needed some time think about it but then
