yeah I think it's probably commitments other places you know touring everywhere else and uh they got it at the beginning of the year usually around this time the even rest of the world it's quiet so you know they got us first bicentennial incentive sounds a bit sexual with AC/DC bi um no it’s nothing for us it was just a the right time in fact I didn't know until I got here that it was a Bicentennial um it depends some sometimes you can get here like last year I got here twice um but before that one in 3 years uh so if ever I can get here I try to get here yeah still the best city well for me because I grew up in Sydney so know me way about about one of the best cities in the world for me yeah yeah you know a lot of uh people from Sydney would probably deny it but yeah for me it's it’s pretty much well I think people want they value these days I mean they're paying big money to see a rock show I mean you've gotta give me the the value or whatever maybe I I've never liked things done on the cheap you know if you if I think if you get to a stage I think people really expected of them I mean it's great to be able to walk in this more place it's more building just play but I mean just something but I think when people are paying um good money for something they want to see something for that money and when the boredom I can wear everything anything that was going you know a gorilla suits anything you know but it was all all for the same thing you know make people look and see what's going on I remember Bon Scott climbing all over the Horde and the vilian on a spider web one night and and we wouldn't get him down  well that schoolboy always which for me was always it helped me you know because it when I put on the suit I could hop on stage and it gives me a bit of confidence you know yeah it doesn't it just as soon as it goes on you get this impish feeling in the cinders I've got the suit on nothing can go wrong so it's always for me a bit of confidence jailbreak uh around the world
