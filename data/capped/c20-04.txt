well I'm delighted to be on this program because I have such pleasant memories of my first visit to Korea which was which was in 1953 when Miss Dole was just five years of age and I remember on that occasion how impressed mrs Nixon and I were but the fact that it was a very very cold day that we were wearing overcoats and there were thousands and thousands of Korean children and just little cotton suits that were out there waving American Korean flags and at that time I said to her uh that there's no question these people are going to make it they're so strong well the disagreement that we had has been well publicized it was called the kitchen debate uh because it occurred at an exhibition that the United States said they're in a model kitchen uh we were talking about what was going on there but also what was going on in the world and it went on and on and the differences that we had have been uh very widely publicized but as we neared the end of the conclusion that near the end of the the discussion Kershaw who was a very volatile man stuck his finger into my chest and he said your grandchildren will live under communism well I responded your grandchildren will they live in freedom at the time I was sure he was wrong but I must admit I wasn't sure I was right but now events have proved that I was right because Kershaw's grandchildren do live in freedom and the great question of our time can they continue to live in freedom or will they revert to the old or a new despotism the prediction I made proved to be accurate not simply because the West stood firm as it did but because communism had a fatal flaw it just wouldn't work uh it was doomed to fail he believed in communism as did all of the leaders who followed him Brezhnev for example believed in communism so did Gorbachev the reason he failed was that he couldn't give up on his belief in communism but communism was an idea which simply would not work it did not produce a better life for people and the Russian people the people of the other republics in the former Soviet Union rebelled against it it's interesting to note that the Communists came to power in Russia through violence in 1917 but they peacefully were thrown out and this is of course gives us a good idea as to what can happen in the future it is a role that the people of the United States don't particularly want uh the United States really would prefer not to have the responsibilities abroad but there's no one else uh looking around the world today if the United States does not lead who is going to lead the Japanese the Chinese the Russians the Germans those are the only other nations that have the military and economic potential to lead so the United States must lead uh second as far as the American people are concerned they do not want to impose their system on anybody else that is why the leadership position is good not just for the United States it's good for the other people in the world uh whether it is Korea or Japan or the nations of Western Europe or the people and what was formerly the third world now we call it the second world uh our only interest is to have them have the opportunity that we have to grow up in a world and peace to choose their own governments through a democratic system if they prefer that and to have freedom and its broadest aspect first the United States must continue its all-out support of the Republic of Korea uh that at least is a deterrent to North Korea if they do engage in aggressive action they're going to commit suicide we have to make it clear that an attack on the Republic of Korea by North Korea would be an attack on the United States we must begin with that then the United States must work through other governments uh the Chinese for example the Russians to the extent they want to play a world role to get them to lean on North Korea uh to abide by the uh non-proliferation treaty and not to go forward with its nuclear weapons program let me say why having nuclear weapons in North Korea cannot be tolerated France has nuclear weapons Britain has nuclear weapons we're not afraid of that because they we know they will never be used aggressively but North Korea is an outlaw regime nobody knows what Ki- Kim il-sung will do uh maybe the South Koreans do but I don't know I don't think our government knows under the circumstance you cannot have in that man's hand or his successors hands these weapons uh which could start not just a war in the Korean Peninsula but in the whole world I would say finally the Japanese are involved here the Japanese do not have nuclear weapons they could get them almost within a matter of months because of their enormous industrial capability in the case that North Korea acquires nuclear weapons that would be a mortal threat to Japan and Japan would have to go nuclear so what we're talking about here is not just the Korean Peninsula we're talking about peace and security in the balance of Asia and the balance of the world well the United Nations could step in but the the problem there is that we say well why doesn't the United Nations do something uh we want to remember that during the Korean War the only reason the United States was able to get the United Nations into that action was that the Russians were absent and could not and Soviets I should say were absent and could not exercise a veto uh I do not think it is enough to say the United Nations can step in and do something about it it means that the great powers that that means the United States China which still has influence there uh Japan to the extent it can have influence in the future and of course the nations of Europe we have to make it very clear uh that we cannot tolerate that situation uh I'm not I don't have an answer to it because what we have to bear in mind here is that North Korea has its problems I mean they have an economy that is a disastrous shape uh the per capita income in South Korea is at least four maybe five times as great as it is in the North uh they need assistance from the west from Japan etc and it's got to be made clear that they've got to choose do they want to grow do they want to join uh the great revolution for progress in the rest of the world or they simply want to have nuclear weapons and then thumb their noses at the rest of the world which as I say leads to suicide oh the military option must be kept open the idea that if only we are for peace they will be four pieces nonsense in dealing with with without law governments we know that I've known it all of my life and you have to as you have dealt with these problems we have to have a military option we have to maintain our strength we must not we the United States must not reduce our forces in Korea uh because the military option is the only is the only kind of activity that's going to deter uh the North Koreans in the meantime we've got to proceed through diplomatic channels since the North Koreans say they would like to have a nuclear-free zone we've got to put all the pressure we can economically and otherwise to get them to abstain from developing nuclear weapons well Russia at the present time is at a crossroads uh it is often said that the Cold War is ov- over and that the West is wanted that's only half true uh because what has happened is that the Communists have been defeated uh but the ideas of freedom now are on trial if they don't work there there will be a reversion to not communism which has failed but what I call a new despotism which would pose a mortal danger uh to the rest of the world because it would have be infected with the virus of Russian imperialism which of course has been a characteristic of Russian foreign policy for centuries we begin with that therefore the West has the United States has all those who want peace and freedom in the world a great state in freedom succeeding in Russia if it succeeds it will be an example for others to follow it will be a book for China for example to follow uh for the other communist states the view that remained if it fails it means that the hardliners in China will get a new life they will say it failed there there's no reason for us to turn to democracy that's part of what is at stake here uh the other point that we have to have in mind is that it's vitally important that it succeed because it means that Russia which for 70 years has been exporting or trying to export the ideas of communism to the world will now be exporting the ideas of freedom the ideas of democracy the goods of freedom it means that Russia for example will be able to export goods that'll be a huge export market for example for the United States and other countries so I would simply sum it up to save for our Korean audience it means a great deal to Korea too because Russia the Soviet Union I should say was a very strong supporter of North Vietnam Russia will not be a supporter of North Vietnam and that means that they we have here a potential ally joining with the United States and other country other free countries in putting pressure on North Korea not to go forward with the nuclear option it's the tendency among many of those in the foreign policy establishment of which you were a member incidentally uh to emphasize style uh to be impressed by style more than substance Gorbachev had style he was smooth uh he had an elegant wife and incidentally he did some positive things he did open up uh the Soviet Union Yeltsin made I mean Gorbachev made Yeltsin possible but it looking at the two men they both began the same they were both born as peasants uh garbage off became a man of the world Yeltsin remained a man of the people they were different in another respect Yeltsin has repudiated both communism and socialism Gorbachev would not do so uh and many of the observers didn't see that the reason Gorbachev failed was that he sincerely believed in the communist idea right to the present day if you follow his uh column recent column in The New York Times and then he sincerely believed that the Soviet empire should remain intact it was those beliefs that brought him down Yeltsin on the other hand is one who is believes in democracy believes in free markets and that's why we should put our chips on him at this time oh yes it is difficult uh the main thing is is to get plenty of advice but then the president has got to decide uh and in this case for example the briefers were overly impressed by the style factor they said because Khrushchev drank too much and he wore sloppy clothes and spoke bad Russian grammar uh that he was not going to be a strong leader he was one of the brightest leaders in fact he had the quickest reaction time of any leader I've ever met and with Yeltsin they say that uh well he's bourish he he'd uh for example one that one columnist made the point that at a state dinner he used to lick caviar off with his fingers and butter and let me say you Yeltsin may not know what kind of a fork to use at a state dinner but he has a very sharp political knife uh and that's what they failed to see Yeltsin the man is a very strong leader uh he has his weaknesses uh but he has good people around him but mainly he believes in the right thing he believes in democracy he believes in freedom he believes in free markets and therefore he deserves our support no question about it the purpose of popularity is not to horde it but to use it uh a popular president should use his popularity to accomplish great uh objectives and here's where Yeltsin comes in Yeltsin was enormously popular after he put down the couch standing on top of that tank facing down card-carrying killers uh from the Stalinist coup attempt but then he had to make a decision to go toward the free market in order to do that he had to let the prices go up that risked his popularity his popularity is down but without doing that there's no way they can move to a free market that is using popularity rather than hoarding it my advice to any president any leader when you are popular don't just sit on it use it to accomplish great goals the nerve is more important than any other factor in leadership well as you know there is a great move on at the present time among what I call the new isolations to have the United States to withdraw from Europe because there's no longer a Soviet threat and to withdraw from Asia for the same reason I believe that it's very important for us to maintain a presence in Europe I think it is indispensable that we do so in Asia if we withdraw from Asia what do you have you have Japan a an economic giant uh but a military militarily no nuclear weapons do you have China with nuclear weapons you have Russia with nuclear weapons now Russia it's true is not the Soviet Union but it still has nuclear weapons what does Japan do of the United States withdraws it has two options one it can make a deal with the Chinese or the Russians or it can go nuclear what I am simply saying is that the United States presence in Northeast Asia is absolutely indispensable the Japanese it is not in our interest it's not in their interest their own people don't want to go they have a stronger military we should not encourage them to have a stronger military if we leave they have no choice but to do so  well there is a view that Japan should increase its military spending I support only military spending for defensive purposes under no circumstances do I think it should Japan to develop an offensive cloud uh because basically we have to face it the memories the World War two is still out there that would terrify Koreans it would terrify people in Taiwan it would terrify people in Southeast Asia the Indonesians and the rest we cannot have that happen it is not in our interest it's not in the interest of Japan of the Japanese people for them to increase their military potential that's why we have got to retain the American guarantee of Japan's security against outside uh aggression uh and on the other hand Japan should increase what it does in the foreign aid area uh there it is already doing slightly more than the United States it should do massively more it should pay for the free ride it gets on the military side by increasing its foreign aid particularly for example to Russia it should bear one of the major burdens of helping the the freedom survive in what is now Russia and of course the other uh former Soviet states uh the description of cork in the bottle has been used of course in other uh respects as you know around the world uh I would accept it though uh I would accept it in this sense that if we move out if the American troops move out uh from Japan uh Japan is not going to sit there as a helpless giant it this is the second most powerful economy in the world the Japanese people uh have a a great and proud history and if we move out they are going to then have to take steps to increase their armaments enormously and that would have tragic repercussions all over Asia in the rest of the world I wouldn't put it in terms of offsetting anybody else let me say the Korean American relationship is good for Korea and it's good for us uh it's remarkable that Korea has done what it did see Japan uh after World War two had an economic miracle but but Japan had an infrastructure of people who knew how to run uh a modern private enterprise economy Korea had nothing it had to start from scratch it had a per capita income of only $50 when I visited there in 1953 it's now $4,600 uh that is very exciting Korea also has a mil- military potential and Korea should play uh a role uh diplomatically on the world scene Korea is a valued ally of the United States uh it they need us uh to assure their defence against a possible attack from North Korea but we need them uh as an influential partner on the world scene it's now in the United Nations because Korea can be a better example for example to and now what I call second world countries of what countries that are low on the totem pole in terms of production can do if they adopt free market and democratic principles a democratic growing strong Korea is in our interest but it's in the interests of those who cherish freedom all over the world  well first uh naturally I'm for it that's like saying I'm I'm against sin uh because basically it's unnatural for Korea to be divided just as was unnatural for the Germans to be divided the Germans are now together but for the Koreans to get together will be more difficult than for the Germans to get together because the differences between North and South are even much greater than were the differences between West Germany and East Germany what has to happen here is that the Koreans themselves must work this out but on the other hand others can play a role the Chinese for example one of the reasons it's very important for the United States to continue a very good close relationship with China is that China has good relations with North Korea China can influence North Korea I believe Russia maybe can and not as much as the Soviet Union could have possibly but Russia at least will have the intention to do so uh I think too that as far as the United States is concerned uh we will use all of our influence in world world forums for example including the UN uh the nuclear proliferation organizations and so forth we will use our influence uh to get the North Koreans to abandon their plans to go forward with a nuclear capability and therefore to pave the way for north-south agreement as I as I know as you know much better than I and our audience knows much better much better there been some encouraging signs lately but it's been only rhetoric as far as North Korea is concerned it has been substance as far as South Korea is concerned what has to happen now is that all of us the Chinese the Americans uh the other interested parties in that area the Japanese as well might play a role have got to bring economic and political on the north uh to face up to the reality that this unnatural division must end because it's good for both that it end it's difficult at this time because we're in a recession it's a mild one but it's the longest one since the end of World War two there's a tendency then in both political parties to turn inward and say we've got to devote our attention to our problems at home and let the rest of the world take care of itself I think we have to realize however that foreign and domestic policy are like Siamese twins neither can survive without the other uh the American people will not support a strong foreign policy unless you have a strong domestic policy and by the same token uh the United States cannot be at peace in a world of wars we can't have a strong American economy and a sick world economy so
