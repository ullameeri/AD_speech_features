it really makes sense to draft or bring into your team someone that can play more than one position if you can find that person what makes Jeanette so unique well there's a lot of things actually um she and May Moore were probably the only two players in the draft that have been to four Final Fours so that that experience at the highest level um she can play the one the two or the three she's six foot which is big for a guard um she is the best three-point shooter in uh in the draft so she can spread the floor she isn't what we call a push guard she the minute she catches the ball she looks up the floor to kick it ahead so she's going to create opportunities I think in transition for uh you know for Katie and for Catch and for Tammy and Davenport and Jane Smith everybody that's running the floor uh and I think just think her size you know she has the ability to post up smaller guards uh and then I I guess the last thing would be you you know when you get a Stanford player you know you're getting a player with a very high basketball IQ um someone that's been coached by one of the great coaches in our game uh and anytime you can get a Stanford player a Tennessee player a Connecticut player you know you know what you're getting and so she's just in a lot of ways the whole package you know she's not perfect we know that at times it looked like she struggled against the pressure from Texas A&M but so did everybody uh in the tournament and uh we feel like we can continue to work with that area and continue to proof of all had the skills and wow you know the um sky's the limit for her because she can already knock down those long range come off of a screen catching shoot kicking the head catch and shoot come off of a two-man game and top two three and that's just something you can't change I think it’s it’s apt to make her in a situation where we can play she and Brie together and they can be interchangeable Brie can run the wing and she can bring the ball down the floor she can run the wing and and and they can be interchangeable and so when you have that versatility which we did not have that with Tally love Tally to death just love her to death good it has been a had a huge positive impact on our team but what we wanted to do with this pick was bringing a guard with tremendous scoring and shooting ability uh and size you know we we we wanted a little bit more size when you look at some of these women that they're introduced in on this draft I mean they're bigger they're stronger uh from you know the last few years you can just treat the growth of the game as far as their strength and size too  and that's when we were big and I think the interesting thing right and the exciting thing I think about this team is if we really want to go big you know we have the potential with Poland Katie Douglas Tamika Catchings and now we've added Chara Eli who is a big win a big 3 folder um and course another Tennessee player um so we ended Chan Smith and Davenport and Tammy sudden Brandon's right so we have the potential really to go big if we want to um and you like to have that um that versatility um especially getting some of these teams that that are getting bigger too um I I think when I saw them beat Connecticut and I believe she had  30 31 and you know Connecticut prides themselves and their defence and in all the things that they can do and that really know after that game I was falling with her and watching every game of hers that came on TV um and hoping that there might be a shot for us to get her um just because of the things that she can do and how she can help us and what we want to do you know I always said we need five more
