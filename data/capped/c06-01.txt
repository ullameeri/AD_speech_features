it's an experienced team thank goodness finally um and and I think um with that just the maturity and the focus that they have and the drive um I know they are excited um that we are we're pretty healthy overall and um and again is a is ahead of Schedule so that's going to help our depth on the inside uh without question um so I I just I feel really good about them and and I think they they're more confident now you know and and they've earned that right because they've invested more and they know what to expect every day and I think they uh they're obviously looking forward to the exhibition games and um and and certainly um when we go to Louisville that's going to be a real task for us um you know to go on the road and um you know they're anticipating a sell out there so we're we’re going to we're going to be tested um quite a bit and then obviously with our trip to the Virgin Islands that's you know that's going to be it's going to be a a good test as well we have three games there that are that are pretty um competitive well I think for for this team it's it's very important that we stay healthy and um I um right now I feel really really good about it but you know injuries happen and and unfortunately we've we've had some of those and um they've mounted up but um right now going into this season you know we are we are healthy pretty much across the board and uh again with with our freshmen I I think they're they're more mature and and and and they they really I think will help us as well particularly with the guard play I don't want to be paranoid every time I go to practice and think oh you know who's going to who’s going to have a problem today um I think we have to go in there very optimistic and um know that that we do have depth and that's that's to our advantage in case we have an injury and you know that's just part of the game um it's it's part of the game and and we just have to you know not be um concerned about it all the time but just really um coaching our our team and inspiring them every day and you know they they're going to be challenged you know we've we're going to have a tough schedule and you know in our conferences is tough so and and certainly if if you look at at who we're playing you know I I can't wait to play Baylor I'll be honest with you um just see where we are you know that be a that's going to be a great gauge for us Kentucky's I mean they're they’re really solid but there's a there's so many good teams out there now that uh we know that we have to be ready and it's a a possession by possession and and we can't we can't look ahead we can't look behind it's uh in the moment it depends on the situation and um you know there's times that we're going to want to we’re gonna want to go inside because of our depth inside and our size we we definitely have a size advantage in in a lot of situations there but our guard play isi s uh it's it's the best it's been in in quite a while and I I think um our guards are understanding how how to push and how to get the ball inside um Megan Simmons has really been very very impressive um she is she is quick on quick and uh loves to attack the rim um so I like I like her game I think um I think Lauren Avamp she is a true point guard and she's she´s going to distribute the ball there's no doubt um she can also obviously hunt paint points and but a very unselfish player and I I think she will uh do a good job in terms of getting our postgame uh touches I think glory is better um I think she's playing more within herself and not trying to do too much um Dean has done a great job um just
