I don’t usually wear a flock I want to show the lollies again they're not bad actually are they’re quite straight yeah look look look look but I’ve got it’s such a I’ve become a bit like Peggy wearing trousers all the time with a jacket oh so I thought you know it is it’s quite good well actually I'm a bit nervous I don't know why  well I don't know because they told me I got to do all this whoever you know you know I I haven't seen it since my birthday is a disgrace my husband said would you say a few words on my 70th birthday the nice little party a few friends yeah it gets up he tells all these things you shouldn't say all the things things my old man don't know about yeah it was lovely thank you thank you oh and my Kenny oh I loved it I did I mean I didn’t particularly want a party because but it’s other people say but it’s your seventy oh you must Barbara this is very special so you know I got people near you know and a few family and that  was really nice I enjoy and I I chose a place where I could look at my beloved London I love London with a passion and you know it was lovely wasn't it it was very posh you could see over Kensington Gardens and all that yeah it was nice really nice I do I really love oh I really love it love it love it absolutely oh that's good but you know but I like most cities I love Liverpool I love that’s terrific yeah yeah yeah yeah we well we all do that I mean Ken Livingstone we all moan about in thanks God is dead so we can all moan about him in it I know she's got herself into a terrible situation no well what's happened is it's because she hasn't got a man I think that's what it is not that I'm asking for them to bring me a fellow in because I'm too old for all that all that friends and teeth and and I don’t wanna know and people let's face it don't want to see 70-year-olds kissing they really leave that to the young people but I think it's because she hasn't got someone organizing her life and she's not very good with money she never has been and of course she paid for the wedding for Phil that was her present to him she had the the Vic done up not that it noticed not a blind bit different is it they oh we're going to do this and I walked out is that it no don’t don’t is that it no that was it you know no I I I thought it was going to be white and cream and lovely but I suppose they wanted to keep the original uh so there was that and then she went on that cruise spent too much money bought herself a little diamond which I've forgotten to wear recently because you you get these storylines it's all about and like we've got a dog where's the dog I haven’t seen it for three weeks I keep going I keep saying uh uh shut the door kick the dog in the kitchen you know so that’s what I mean
