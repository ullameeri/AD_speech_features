my favourite leading men I knew somebody's going to ask me that question um I don't have a favourite because uh there are so many different facets to good actors uh I would say to work with Spencer Tracy was an absolute dream you couldn't do anything that he didn't go right along with you you could stand on your head and he would turn you upside down say you look prettier this way or something you know um Tyrone Power was darling to work with because he he was um my age exactly and uh we had big crushes on each other we did about four or five pictures together I think uh I I loved working with him Clark Gable was marvellous to work with because he he was exactly what you saw on the screen and a wonderful he man who was charming with women uh wonderful with men had a lovely sense of humour I've I’ve never heard him complain about anything I did two pictures with him and uh he was a joy uh Ray Milland was fun to work with and because he he we had a drunk scene he had to play one time and he was worried for two days and I said what are you so worried about and he said well I’m an I’m I when I get drunk and I get mean I'm not very attractive I said well don't just laugh throw everything and that's what he did and I saw the show the other day is not bad at all it's uh pretty good it's not bad the best kisser I didn't answer that did I um I frankly was a little bit in love with every leading man I ever worked with probably because they were all very handsome and and charming and and I was and still am the most romantic idiot in the world and I they dream all the time and so and they're charming on the set and you
