well I think uh anytime you win your first ever Eastern Conference championship and then you're able to uh go on and end up in the fifth game of the finals uh you're continually thinking back to that was a wonderful time for our team is a great time for our fans uh but I think we're at a point now where you you know it's a fun memory and now we're focused on 2010 you know how do we get better how do we repeat as Eastern Conference champions how do we go back to the finals um and this time win a championship and I think you know the uh everybody is going to be better with Sacramento uh contracting and those players going to other teams uh it's going to create it even more parity in the league so we're really focusing on the draft we're focusing on free agents uh we're focusing on keeping our core group together uh I think we had a great uh uh group of players good chemistry on and off the court uh so we want to make sure we keep this group together and maybe tweak it just a little bit and get just a little bit better but I think we need to improve our field goal shooting percentage I thought one of the things that uh that we did good at times was shot really well from the three-point line but I think consistently all of our perimeter players and our four player you know we're not asking our center to shoot threes but we're asking our one two three and four players uh to be very good three-point shooters and I think that's an area that we can improve on and I think if we do uh across the board a couple of percentage points uh you know we can win four or five more games you know I'm a huge Briann January fan I thought we got the steal of the draft and we were able to get her with the sixth pick um she just did a super job for us off the bench played quality minutes and not only did she played the point for us she played the uh the two guard and so there were times when we had Tolly and Brie in there together and I think that her versatility the fact that she is a combo guard makes her even more valuable uh we're excited about the fact that she's over in Turkey now playing really well I think she maybe had 24 points and a gob of assists the other night and getting some more experiences over there I think that she continues to grow our game um it's you know it's just only going to help our team you know she's a push guard she's an attacking guard she can get to the rim she can you know draw and kick and and then I think she's got to continue to work on her 3-point shot well I think it was tough and also a surprise any time you've got a a team that's won as many championships as they had the you know the tradition they had developed there it was was kind of a stunner but I think we all know that everyone in all walks of life is dealing with tough economic times uh I think we were just fortunate that a uh an owners group in Tulsa was willing to purchase them and now that team is moved to to Tulsa Oklahoma and I think that team that team in that city um are really going to rally around um the WNBA franchise being there um so um you know it's it changes the East it changes the dynamics in the east and they were a great rivalry for us and now we've got to uh refocus here and s- you know and is our great is our number one Ron where we going to be Connecticut is it going to be Washington is it going to be Atlanta I'm not sure well there's mixed um mixed feelings about this draft some people think it's you know there's three really great players in the draft and it really drops off um I think for us having the 11th pick um you know we've got to do our homework we've got to really research some of these players and see if we can't find a sleeper at that lemon spot um we sure got a great pic last year with the six pick so we're we’re exploring all of our options even the possibility of trading the 11th pick well I think one of the areas that we need to focus on is the fact that this is Tully's last year in the WNBA and so a year from now Brienn of course will be our starting point guard but who is Brienn’s back up so we have to evaluate do we need another perimeter player that could slide over and play the point that so got to be something in the back of our mind based on Tully's age and where she is in her career um I think we're always looking for a a great um um young post player I think everyone is and when you look at it something Tammy and where she is in her career you know if we could find a young center to develop for the future that might be something that we would look at but then again you always when when you get ready to draft you know you're always thinking about who is the best player regardless of position available so all of those three things will probably come into play um as we approach that pick I don't travel to games um in the um fall you know in October I mean in November December um I mostly watch the pre-conference games on television and then through the month of January I continue to watch sometimes eight games a day on TV and then we use those televised games to kind of narrow down who we really want to go see in person you know who do we want to go see up close to talk to the uh coach uh you know watch them practice um and so we're in the process now of really narrowing our list down and getting out more um to see them in person course will cover um extensively the conference tournaments um and I think it's fair to say that we've got our top I don't know 15 18 um and and we're really focusing in on the players that we think the box that we think of players that will be available at 11 well um I took a break immediately after the season we did exit interviews and then I went to Florida um South Florida for about a week just to rest I think I think everyone knew but you know I was really struggling with the flu by the end of the season and so I I don't even really remember the week in Florida because I was so exhausted um you know from the season but also from from fighting that um what I would like to do is is have one more time to go to Florida before the season starts where I could really enjoy it but I spent a lot of time at home with my family um you know this is the time of the year when I'm able to uh join my bridge club and we play bridge and uh spades and all types of cards so that that's kind of a relaxing thing for me and then I love to read um but there's so many games on TV now I can I can find um a game every night um on on the s- with with the with the satellite and then on you know Saturdays and Sundays that's when I can find eight to ten games so uh even though I'm not in Indianapolis but but about a one week out of each month um I'm still from Tennessee watching basketball games and I'm also re-evaluate in our season one of the things that I'm doing is working on our on our playbook and our system and tweaking it and deciding you know what we want to keep what we want to add um so there's still a lot to do and I can do it from from um Grace in Tennessee Oh gosh oh man well you know I've been experimenting some with my fried green tomatoes um fried okra um you know in Tennessee we fry everything um so um I don't know that I have a specialty I've been toying with the idea of frying some sweet potatoes because I saw it on the Paula Deen cooking show and by the way that is I watch the food network but you know when I'm not watching basketball and watching that food network for recipes I really enjoy uh uh you know the Iron Chef competition the Chopped um what's really neat about that channel is is now they've somehow taken food and turned it into comp titian so I really get a kick out of that but uh I'm always trying some kind of new recipe is in particular if it's fried well you know it's a it's a tremendous honouring you know I think anytime you're inducted into a Hall of Fame um that's all sports you you know that makes it unique you know this is men and women from every every sport there is that have had outstanding careers and somehow they're tied to the state of Tennessee either they grew up there or they participated uh or coached at a high school or college in that state and when you look at the 40 50 years of that Hall of Fame and the people that are in that Hall of Fame Fame I mean it's so overwhelming uh I mean I'm looking back and there's Wilma Rudolph's name and Neryl Wide and Pat Summitt and you know I'm not even going to go on the on the male side just the tremendous women that have been honoured so you know it it's really special to me and it's going to be even more special because all of my family um will be able to come to Nashville for that event so and a lot of my friends you know from all over the country are coming back for it so it's it’s going to be a really neat night right I don't know what's going on it makes me think I'm getting either I'm near death or I'm awfully old because that usually doesn't happen in that short of a span but again um the Indiana basketball hall of fame you got to be kidding me I mean that's a tremendous honour uh you know basketball in Indiana's it's it’s like a religion you know so um it's special a lot of my former players will be able to come back um I know a lot of my former Purdue players some of my assistants that work for me uh through the years are coming some of my family will be able to come up and of course one of my former players is now the coach at Purdue is also being honoured it at that hall of fame banquet so I hope all of our fever fans um uh here in Indianapolis uh will either go on our website or the or the Indiana Hall of Fame website and see about tickets we'd love to have a huge turnout of a uh Fever people at the at the hall of fame induction
