I'm doing wonderful oh yeah definitely yeah this kind of started a lot of things off it sure was yeah John Hartford God rest his soul he was a he was really a good guy had his own thing going he like he had the song and dance and he'd played the banjo and dancing he actually brought the plywood um amplified plywood with him or he played that was his rhythm wanted to play banjo and guitar yeah and got in the top hat uh I found him through The Smothers Brothers when we did the Goodtime Hour he was he was one of the packages and the Summer Brother Smother show that I hosted it was a bunch uh I don't have one uh John's was the first one naturally but yeah John did it in his own imitable way but it um when I your song our singer sing a song I'm not necessarily listen to the way the singer is singing a song I'm sho- I’m really listening to see how good the song is and then that you know s- some songs you can't mess up anybody can say you know that's amazing in it Tammy what a great singer she was wow yeah that was uh I think the body of that it's uh it’s not oh it’s not only were the songs fabulous but uh the way Jimmy arranged everything when Jimmy Webb you know he he writes it I think he's got an arrangement in his head as as soon as it's the song is done he could think about where he can put this or where he can put that Jimmy's the only guy that I ever knew that used uh augmented fourths in his music an- and they fit uh Al Delory was a he was he was the guy that was a the A & R man there but um Jimmy and I were producing we did what we wanted to do and um we had the final say on everything and yeah 62 61 yeah I don’t I was with the Champs for a while a a road band Champs and then that band was uh Seals and Crofts uh uh Bob Morris was in the band uh i- but it was studio work was what I really really got my teeth into because I I fou- I I found something that I could really learn a lot from by listening to all the great players uh the great producers uh I got to work with most of them and uh you can you can really see you know which ones can chew the hay right I’d I’d sing harmony well I told him it's a I mean I go- Merl sessions were good money I I I got played for playing rhythm on this on track they just they used to do the track you know um an- and they wouldn't have the singer there but they started saying they started charge you charging him another $30 a session if they didn't sing it you know that was great because none of the field Spector stuffs had any singing on them until so it's finished no really and then they put the vocal on it which was which is a way to do it I would imagine cause you can hear everything that way but it was a the session days were really really cool I got to play with some of the greatest musicians in the world in fact th- they were Los Angeles is a I think is the hotbed of incredible musicians uh I actually got to do a session too for live from someplace in Vegas with uh with uh Tex William the Tex William John I'm a fella with a heart of gold away it was at 62 we did live from uh that were they bunions would they have the gambling place yeah uh that was that oh yeah Merle's boy he was he was he was one of the very best guitar players in the world I think had his own style you know it was Merle old when you heard him yeah oh fabulous that was my part that was the harmony yeah I did ryth- I play rhythm just I play rhythm cause the guy that played with Merle got he he did all the lead stuff I did yeah right I I played rhythm and uh and sing uh we just played rhythm hall Merle sing  and then Bonnie and I over dubbed the harmonies that was and it would really worked out well that way and I made a lot more money that way eh eh oh we we you get paid for this tracking and then you get paid for the singing oh yeah a lot I grew up on uh Grand Ole Opry and whatever we could get on the radio whether it was big band or uh wasn't a lot of country stuff around in the that was on radio it was like it was all like uh you know uh Glenn Miller uh big band stuff of and then the big band artists of those days and then when they got started adding a little more country and a little more country to uh I had more variety that way it seemed like my uncle Boo was the one that got me started in it basically he he was the guitar player and uh he was very good one two and hey I actually were around with him because my brother's never never advanced his GDC kind of thing you know and but Boo and I we we kind of went all out you know and we started listening to I started listening to Django Reinhardt when I went to Albuquerque and that's that my big influence in was was Django Reinhardt because uh I think unarguably I don't think there's a guitar player in the world that wouldn't recognize Rein- Reinhardt as the best guitar player uh if they did then people would know that they didn't know that much oh yeah oh yeah it's just huge fused together that little finger mine is becoming that way maybe I'll play better if I get that little finger out of the way uh but Ryan Hart was a definitely Stephane Grappelli was definitely the the fiddle player yeah Sears Roebuck about $7.50 you know had the the cowboy down here with a rope up and that's what I learned to play on and uh it was something like those were good songs well I had radio five days a week Big Bill and the Sandier Mountain Boys we didn't actually oh yeah it was like as I think was head and Wed head and West that was our theme song it was uh oh wow speedy West and Jimmy Brian yeah that was our theme song for a good uh noon day round up we had a  pedal steel player but it was but it was a good band to everybody really kicked oh yeah man had them hats on cowboy boots you just you could kill cockroaches in the corner with them man oh yeah I loved it I thought it was raw you know and and some of it was it was really it was a lot of noise but it felt good you know that's the way I kind of describe early rock ´n´ roll  in fact I played on Pat’s session of that when I did studio work and that’s when I heard it I think It was that but I that’s where I first heard it yeah with Johnny Rivers I saw it in a studio 3 there was western 3 and it said by the time we get to Phoenix I didn't know if it was the you know the flight of the Phoenix the bird or if it was Phoenix the town or and that was the interesting what by the time I get to Phoenix why would you want to get to Firebird in there with you whatever it was that's what I was thinking about at the time uh but no no I had cut it and then I played on Pat Boone's session because I was still doing studio work in Tucson yeah oh yeah from uh that I II was started looking for his stuff and then he out of the blue he came out with Wichita Lineman I said my word my word that’s one of those good ones was he couldn't find a melody so he just talked part of it uh I think I asked him to do a chart how did we meet it was in a bar somewhere well I won for vocal performance in Phoenix yeah well when you you know when uh uh when you see a talent that to just you know as rounded as Jimmy Webb says as far as a songwriter for the piano player for it that's uh you you pay attention to them and you you know it it's your it because how many times in a lifetime do you can you run across a Jimmy Webb whatever they're few and far between once that's exactly right man it's like you know Dionne Warwick running across Bacharach man it’s Boodle O'Brien I always thought you wrote that song yeah uh get back together have some fun run off some stuff uh because I really seriously want to do an album with Jimmy uh is some of the new stuff and we’re we're going to see how that goes this trip and uh maybe record some stuff or so you also listen back and see see how works out that way and I think raw is pretty good I looked out of my door in Phoenix one day and I hear this hawk go and he it was uh it was one of the buses that uh that came that went from like Nogalas down into Mexico it was yellow and pink and Merle had just uh rather Weiland had just bought it and he wanted he drove it up there well I had well I that place I live there is a the Biltmore here he come down there with that bus it was like a 1950 something bus and here he come down through there and it was pink and blue and that's Whalen that was over six seven years ago were oh gosh yes not nobody you'd know this was after he but he he still went back play Jay then and it was Waylon was just an awesome talent and yeah uh capital and release it as a single they wouldn't release mine as a single so I told him to go to hell it was a little it was a little more ex explanatory than that because the guy really ticked me off then I'd finished highwayman and and there's one and he had heard and he said no he said that's not really what we have in mind for you the new regime at Capitol you know and they played me something by the neck it was I think it was my Sharona uh and I I just I looked at guy right now I know this and he's I said but highwayman he said no that in danger Russian we have for you and I said well I know you I I really he made me so mad I just one night I left Capital I hadn't been back since all they did was they really they printed up 10,000 copies which was mandatory and that was it of highwaymen and it was I was so for Jimmy's sake I was just so glad that uh I went back to Nashville and played on the played played rhythm on the record  yeah I wanted I wanted just for Jimmy’s sake of course there was a little revenge factor there that was probably adding in Jimmy Jimmy Bowen uh he and I can't think of the guy's name and while the old session guys around there the arranger I can't think of his name but they're they’re  the ones that they put in fact I laid down the because they they were in session they didn’t they didn't know the songwriter highwayman I don't think because I put up I put a work track on the vocal for a vocal work track on it for him the next voice is a little tells us the first force tells that story great the second voice tells tells us that story great and uh it just it just built on the the and then when Cash comes in it's like bang it's a great song that's incredible what key is that in Jimmy C minor hey let me let me show you how quick I can do that we can get our we can dig a big hole for ourselves and all of a sudden the top comes open and everything comes out in light it's always
