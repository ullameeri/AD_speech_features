well it's the it’s staying healthy is one thing being on the road is another it really is uh uh a difficult time when we first went to California years ago they made motion pictures and television and things there they don't make them there anymore they make them around the county and you're good to be in motion pictures you're gonna be literally in the last year and a half I guess we've been on location in Cleveland and um Toronto and Buffalo and Albany and uh Atlanta well we carry on like a caravan a lot of stuff with us I mean like a uh uh a rowing machine and an Exercycle yes well I they well they greet me in the morning and say good morning Darrin and I say good morning yeah that’s it and uh no we try we try to get in shape a little bit well that and my wife and a few other things she's the best exercise equipment I've got yes she does indeed well yeah it's it's hard though you know when you get out of town it really is because you don't have the you know unless you carry your whole kitchen with you you depend upon what's in the apartment you know and we've given up hotel living oh that's it I mean we've just had it the you you look at a room menu and by the time you're there three days you know it by heart yeah so you say well let me see we'll take number three on the right side and four in the column B oh immediately and everything is filled with salt and sugar so we try the whole goes things back well I'm not but Kathy is and which is fortunate for me uh in so far that I don't have to worry too much about it except when I'm on a location alone and that’s terrible we were up in Toronto doing a Christmas story and I took an apartment and I cook by myself Kathy was stuck down here in New York doing some things in business that we have and I put on about 20 pounds oh yes I'm a wonderful cook and I can't stop eating that's great for you yeah you know and and uh view and oh I love it uh that was nothing about I just have a nice little robe that I put on and and uh the the phot- photographer got there early actually and he yeah he caught me out in the garden and said that's fine hold it right there terrific snap and that was the end no no I do got caught with my robe on you know uh yes Karl Kent is no food nothing at all no it's lettuce and greens and uh I try to sneak in as much proteins as I can you know that's what she does too but we we try to keep it down and uh no starch no bread I say where was a where’s my toast for breakfast and she says you ate it didn't you know that you’ve already had yes thank God well I say 15 she says twelve so somewhere out there there's a discrepancy in there it really had to do with a change of decades we have married a New Year's Eve 1969 so you figure it out it’s her privilege I mean as a lady right I loved it I loved it that's one of the reason I'll never do game shows you have to do things like I can't stand it never never I don't even swing my hips a lot no I swim that's about it yeah and the rowing machine with a bicycle and that's enough I think you know that and healthy uh push-ups you look marvellous I must say well I knew him when he was chubby you know bless your heart no it’s always a charm yeah we’ll do it again
