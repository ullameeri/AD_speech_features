well that's one of the first times I've ever seen myself on television as I was telling you before the show began uh I simply have a phobia about that but uh I must say I looked a bit younger than but I was  well it's very difficult to reconcile and I understand that uh because uh Watergate was a breach of trust uh I think to keep it in perspective somewhat and I think it is important that as we consider this historical segment of the program that we put it in perspective that 1972 as you know was a very big year a lot of things were going on uh Winston Churchill once wrote uh that uh strong leaders uh usually do the big things well but they foul up on small things and then the small things become big I should have read that before Watergate happened in 1972 we went to China we went to Russia uh we ended the Vietnam War effectively by the end of that year uh those were the big things and then here was a small thing and we fouled it up beyond belief uh it was a great mistake it was wrong as I pointed out over and over again uh but under the circumstances now people as they judge that period have to see what we accomplished and what we did wrong and for the future I would advise all those that follow me and the position of president do the big things as well as you can but when a small thing is there deal with it deal with it fast get it out of the way because if you don't it's going to become big and then it may destroy you
