um I'm in Sydney Australia right now so and it's a a night time now here now so yeah well if I think back to the time we it's funny we we made that album uh a lot of uh the the songs on that album came from uh we we we had been in America in the U.S and we've been in uh in a actually Miami in a rehearsal room and uh I think probably in this may sound strange strange but uh we went in on a like a Friday and uh and we had been there like a couple of weeks but like uh one weekend we we actually we had not really done weekends we kind of worked for the week and said okay we'll take Saturday and Sunday off and uh but this time we actually said we'll go in on the weekend and uh we went on Friday and came out Monday and we had all the songs ready to go yeah so and the and the only other I think the two other ideas that we had uh um before that that we had worked on really was only two of the tracks one was Highway to Hell we had that one together early and uh and the other one was um Girls Got Rythm those two tracks we we'd had in in the first couple of weeks but it was that weekend when we we ended up uh you know Friday and it into the to the Monday and we came out with uh all of the tracks that you got you know so you know all in all uh from that point on and uh we had actually been working with with uh there was another guy we've been working with but that's the reason why we went on on really in a weekend we went into work because you know we weren't really functioning with him so we decided we'd go in on the weekend and uh work on our own and put it together and uh and then we uh we were lucky you know uh  well it's probably because you know at that time you know we were really you know we were abandoned you know we went from one thing to the next so quick you you know you would you were touring and the next minute you know you were going okay we gotta do it do an album we've got x x amount of time and uh so a lot a lot of things moved so fast yeah and and that and that was with Highway To Hell because immediately after that weekend uh you know my brother Malcolm talked to Mutt Lang the producer uh and he you know he said well give me get me a a cassette of what you got together you know he got that to him quick within a couple of days and then he said right now we'll hook up in London so we then had to you know pack our bags and get on the plane and get to London and England and then we got in the studio over there and it was you know uh you know we had a i think a couple of days with two days with him in a little rehearsal place and then from that point we were into the the studio and uh it was a case of just getting the sound together and then once we got the sound he um you know we you know you get into the songs and so it was and it was it went it went quite rapidly so that was good yeah
