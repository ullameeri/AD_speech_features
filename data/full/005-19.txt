I don’t think uh women can be accused of sex- of sexism it seems to be a crime of which only men can be guilty in our highly charged time I think that's perhaps an overstatement uh it it doesn't distress me uh it has uh I suppose uh perhaps played a part in uh the most important uh benefit of uh what is called stardom which is the degree of control has given me over the work I do and how I do it and who I do it with which is to an actor enormously valuable well I think you'd have to do that anyway uh an actor's a tool is his body uh and it has nothing to do with the parts you’re playing uh it's as important uh for an actor as it is for a ballet dancer or a football player to maintain athletic condition whether you're playing a chariot driver or Henry the eighth dying in bed uh your body is still what you're using and uh actors um perhaps pay more attention to keeping reasonably fit for that reason uh uh economic necessity is a is a strong motivating force no I don’t think so my public has after all been buying our children’s shoes for these many years and we’re we’re both we both understand the the dependence on them well I think in fact like many actors I am a fairly shy person in my private life I don't meet many new people I don't uh acquire new friends readily most of my friends are people I've known a long time uh of course in your work you have a particular kind of intimacy with people you with while you're working with them, but it's a bit like the army you know then that bit is finished and you go onto the next uh and I've had to learn to be a public person because I've been a public person for most of my life now um and I think I've learned to do it properly um that includes meeting a great many people uh not only journalists but all kinds of people uh people that go to the movies uh people that you meet in all kinds of ways in the kind of life I live well they do know they do yes there is uh I think uh that's fairly accurate the public has a certain proprietary right in a performer uh in a way they don't with Sam novelist or a painter whose work is private uh and he can work whether anybody sees it or cares about it but the actor the performer can only work if that's a unique thing about acting uh among the arts you can only you can't practice it you only get to do it if someone says there's a stage there's a movie camera you get to do this part do it and you can only do it uh on the sufferings of the public uh if uh if people don't come to see what you do you don't get to do it anymore and so they do have a uh a stake in you and uh as I see it you have a certain responsibility that to them it's a responsibility you cannot adequately fulfill to each individual but uh I think you have to address it well I think it's probably easier for my son and my daughter than for anybody else that's close to me uh or even casually uh close to me because it's it's been a condition they've adjusted to all their lives they know they've known it from from their births and from the time they were small enough or old enough to consider it at all you know three and four I began saying to them everybody has things that are easier in their lives and things that are harder you get to do a lot of things uh many advantages that other children don't have uh uh you also have some responsibilities um you don't ever have to do interviews but if you're getting off an or a train or a boat and a photographers come up or as a newspaperman asks you a question uh it is your responsibility to answer it courteously and um all the myriad of adjustments which are necessary the fact that I could never take them to Disneyland and places like that um are things that I think they've grown up understanding and adjust to very readily yeah they're they're both very cool and relaxed about it and always have been well I don't have a lot of uh much truck with the inner me well I don't have time for him uh I'm um I have to spend so much time exploring other men's inner inner thems uh and there I remember there was a comic strip in America and it was very popular a few years ago uh in which um there was an alligator and a possum that talked all the time to each other uh exploring philosophical concepts and in one of them the possum Pogo was saying to the alligator his name was Albert he says, I've been thinking a lot about the inner me Albert do you think about the inner me and Albert says nope I don't worry much about the inner me got I got trouble enough with me which out here where I can get my hands on him for the inner me he goes his way I go mine and I I agree with poco oh the great parts always are the hardest Macbeth which I played uh five times um you never totally understand those parts uh every time you do those blades they are mountains which you explore up a different route uh and they become different plays um it's reasonable you yourself are a different person uh the director is different uh in the case of Macbeth the lady Macbeth is different um you play Macbeth with Judas Evelyn differently from the way you play him with Vanessa Redgrave for example and they are monsters of parts all those bonds certainly Macbeth is a very physical it's sanguine in both senses of the word kind of man and I think with the great parts uh you are well-advised to pick those parts to which you can bring the most natural equipment uh it you know you have trouble enough with the parts anyway if you are good casting for them uh for me to try and do Hamlet for example who would uh be infinitely more complex a problem than for a more internal uh intense uh less physical sort of man Hamlet's problem the when not part becomes implausible is when you can't believe that he would delay revenging his father's death that's the central problem of the part you must understand his delays not his delays but as extensions of his inner self if you will and that's uh easier let's say with John Gielgud blaming part uh than with me in Michigan yeah yeah it's beautiful country it was a uh an ideal kind of boyhood uh which I still remember uh uh through a a golden haze as it were um but uh you mean for him to do a story about that well I think writers have to do right from their own experience they certainly write best from it I did in the fore-note of the book well uh characteristic of that journal uh and what its value is if it has a value is that it consists of contemporary entries made at the time they occurred and it extends of course over quite a long period and it designed not as a book but as a working tool as a journal and has served me well and continues to serve me well uh I don't uh I don't have the creative discipline for a writer. I have to write a great deal but uh it uh I marvel at my son for instance who gets up in the morning and has his coffee and goes off and shuts the door to his study and sits there typing away for eight or nine hours I walk around in circles and sharpen pencils and find other things to do look at old letters and look out the window and then sit at the typewriter until drops of blood begin to appear on my forehead well I’m pleased you found it a useful and evocative passage but see that is sharply different in character from the other entries in the film because it is remembered uh memories of my boyhood uh as from the vantage point of a grown man and uh if there's one thing that journal has taught me it's that uh uh our memories are highly selective and we uh in a sense rewrite the events of our own life uh as we remember them uh think everybody does that makes one suspect of history yes well I was in fact literally lonely I lived in a extremely small town uh I went to a one-room school with 13 pupils in eight grades three of them were my cousins um uh there was no one living near where we did in the woods uh in timber country and I suppose that's perhaps one reason I became an actor uh all boys all children uh play imaginary games but when I was growing up there largely alone um I had uh many things to do hunting uh fishing uh rolling track trapping things like that well I don't mean overnight but I mean out in the woods yes but it was a marvellous place to play but I found myself um probably playing pretend games imaginary games um more than boys raised in an environment where there were you could play baseball or football or things of that kind because you couldn't do that and of course there was no television then uh there was a movie theater but it was uh 40 miles away we didn't go very often but uh that probably was uh a factor that and as I sat in my uh innate shyness I think a great many performers uh are shy people and act to find other people to be uh I think uh this is probably not true for comedians and singers uh dancers who are presentational performers but when you're acting you're trying to pretend that the imaginary circumstances of the of the scene are real and that you are in fact that person well I was a lonely kid and of course as an adolescent uh I was miserable uh, having moved by then to uh a big city uh for which I was unequipped uh socially uh and of course I also didn't realize that almost all adolescents are miserable adolescents is a miserable condition well I don’t think adolescence ever figure that out no matter how many friends they have it's perhaps one of the most desperately private times in one's life struggling to uh I suppose it's like the struggles of snake goes through to Shetty's skin to somehow break out of your childhood into at least the doorway to a maturity it was great difficult must have been talking about someone else I have never had more than one secretary and uh uh when you're directing a film you have a production secretary uh in addition probably was talking about a comic uh no I've never had more than one secretary I never travelled with an entourage uh they when they send you on PR tours they usually assume you want someone going along I don't uh I am very dependent on being hand carried but the airlines and uh those people do that uh and I just uh take my little card with what plan I'm getting on and all those instructions and who's meeting me and put it in my pocket and get in the limo and go and then get in the plane and go to sleep well acting as a peripatetic professionalism it's uh and uh I understand that so does my family uh happily when I'm going to make a film uh when my children were younger uh they could readily come with me from location. Films are generally made in the summer and um my wife can almost always come with me depending on her work so but uh that's the nature of of the trade you go other places to do it I think he’s probably speaking of celebrity rather than Hollywood as a geo- geographical environment a celebrity is certainly a corrosive condition which has destroyed some people literally as we know uh as crippled others and that leaves none of us on marked uh I promise you but uh it's simply uh a danger of which you have to make yourself aware and do your best to uh keep clear of its uh of its harms as well as you can
