good afternoon Katie uh things are not as good as they were then uh and that means that they are pretty bad but on the other hand there are some hopeful signs there's no question but that the privatizing of various activities is going forward and the main thing is that all of the leaders I've talked to both those that are for President Yeltsin and those who are against him agree that economic and political reform should go forward uh as they do go forward I think things are going to improve what I saw which was different from last time was that the market was full of goods to sell uh what has happened here is that the free market uh initiative that has been undertaken has raised prices and that's a big big problem the pro- problem of inflation but it also means that the goods are coming to market that the people can buy things and that is a very helpful and useful sign now we've got to get the prices down there's no question but that this market had goods in it the fruit and vegetables and meat and things which were too expensive for the average Russian however I was able to take my own private poll of others that I met the leaders deputies and so forth from pl- places outside of Moscow and the encouraging thing is that despite the hard time despite the inflation that the of the Russian people are still sticking with reforms there will be no return to communism that's the good news the bad news is that there's a great deal of instability it's going to take some time uh to get inflation down and to get on the right track what you say about polls is probably accurate what I'm saying is something quite different it is that despite the fact that people are fed up with the way things are fed up with the gridlock and there is gridlock uh between the president and the Parliament that on the other hand and the long term they don't want to go back to what they had they don't want to go back to communism what they want is a different approach perhaps they made a little slower approach a more fair approach to what they're presently doing it is a very serious challenge President Yeltsin as we know when we saw him come to the United States is a very powerful political personality the Speaker of the Parliament with whom I met yesterday is also a very powerful political personality however even though they disagree with each other very strongly there's no question that both the speaker and President Yeltsin are for the economic and political reforms the question is not whether they're for them but the rate of reform the means to accomplish them that's the good side and what I urged on both of them was get together get your act together because the instability is what is keeping American and other private investment out of Russia uh polls would indicate that that's a very iffy proposition uh I would say that never underestimate Boris Yeltsin he's best when he's in a fight and when I saw him uh he was at the top of his game it's going to be a close call uh but my guess at the present time is that he will be able to survive but it's going to require a major effort on his part to do so  he deserves to stay in power primarily because Katie he believes in what we believe he believes in a non-aggressive foreign policy he believes in freedom of speech he believes in free elections he believes in free markets uh he is the most pro-american Russian leader in history for those reasons we would like for him to stay in power as far as his performance is concerned in Russia that's a very close question uh I would say however I do not see anybody at the moment who will challenge him effectively on that ground but it will be a close call you're certainly right it's on the back burner I've been talking to some of your group here in Moscow no- nobody's paying any attention to them uh but we have to face the fact that foreign policy rates as you know from your own polls only four percent in the polls when President Clinton had his town meeting last week you will recall he got one question in one hour on foreign policy and that was on Bosnia not Russia I would say this what happens to Russia is by far the most important foreign policy issue of this administration or of our time if the Russian reforms fail it's going to completely destroy all of the initiatives that President Clinton has at home Katie if I had any criticism of President Clinton I wouldn't do it and I wouldn't make that criticism on traveling abroad I know you understand that I would say however that on Bosnia it's a very controversial issue here uh as you know historically the Russians have always been for the Serbs uh my view is that as far as President Clinton is concerned he's now in power he's got to determine how far he's going to go and to stand up for the Bostia- Bosnians and frankly to punish the Serbs for their aggression what has to happen here above everything else is that Serbia must not gain from this aggression because it means that in the future it will happen in other parts of the world when ethnic cleansing will be considered to be something that will not be opposed by the United States well if I were in office first I would try to examine the current proposal for settlement that has been advanced by the uh by the team that is out there I would also however insist that as far as that settlement is concerned it must not be one that is a settlement for the settlement state it must be one that does not reward aggression if it rewards aggression we're going to have more of this in other parts of the world because believe me Katie this isn't the only place where this ethnic cleansing is a real possibility when I'm traveling abroad as I said said to you earlier I don't engage in any criticism of our administration that's improper as far as this issue is concerned I think it's very important for President Clinton to bear in mind that we need a strong military I think he should consider the views of the military it doesn't mean that he doesn't uh overrule them on occasion but it's very important that they be listened to and I would say we all ought to wait until the six-month study is made before coming down on any uh policy in this respect as I said I'm not going to go into that I have my own private views but it would not be proper for me to indicate them now while traveling abroad uh it when I think it's appropriate I will address the issue  okay maybe you I'm sure you'll be back well first I'm not going to criticize him and I haven't even read the program and not while I'm traveling abroad but I will say this it is very important for a president in his first State of the Union to take on the unpopular positions and make them popular because as time goes on his own popularity goes down he isn't able to accomplish anything the second point I would make however it is very important that if he has tax increases that he also have spending uh cuts if those tax increases are not balanced with spending cuts it is not going to get approval from this Congress or from the American people well President Clinton and you know of course that I supported President Bush but President Clinton is an excellent campaigner he is an excellent speaker he can move an audience he can move the nation I would say that now is the time for him to take on the tough issues take them on and then convince people that this is the right thing for them I would say however it must not simply be a case of going with what uh would appear popular to the masses and that is to soak the rich if that's all it is that isn't going to fly because soaking the rich means less jobs for the poor well one of the things he campaigned on is you remember Katie was the gridlock would end uh he has very substantial majorities in both the House and the Senate and if he is unable to get his program through it will be a failed presidency  let me say this if I wouldn't criticize Bill Clinton I certainly wouldn't take on Hillary uh because she is a very intelligent very strong very effective first lady uh I think it's very appropriate for her to do what she believes is the right thing to do uh I go back a few years I knew Eleanor Roosevelt uh other first ladies over the year each was different I admired and respected all of them and as far as Hillary Clinton is concerned with her great abilities her intelligence and her strong beliefs is she can be a very effective help to her uh husband the president and I think the American people will like that for example if she can come up with a solution on health care then I say we're all for it because we certainly need one the national health care is a scandal thank you and have a good day remember incidentally it's cold there but it's a little colder in Moscow
