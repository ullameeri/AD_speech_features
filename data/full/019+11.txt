well as you have said um we have bipartisan work on Alzheimer's and so the members of from both sides of the aisle get together and we agree on what we're going to go after uh in terms of resources appropriations for Alzheimer's and we also decide on public policy uh aside from the appropriations aspect of it we're looking to see what else we can do in order to give support to caregivers uh and to patients and so it's a good working relationship I know that uh as our citizens view what is going on in Washington DC they think we're so polarized we can't get anything done but this is one area where we're working together well absolutely and unfortunately uh the press focuses on uh the most controversial and so impeachment uh is at the forefront of the media discussion but a lot of other work is going on uh for instance today in my committee we are going to be working on some very important issues we passed some very important issues out of the committee uh we have to reauthorize XM that is the bank that's responsible for helping us to improve our ability to export our goods our services it's a very important bill uh we just about come to uh an agreement with both sides of the aisles working on it I'm working together uh with the ranking member who is a Republican on my committee on the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program uh we just Uh agreed on tria uh to deal with funding and assistance to insurance companies to ensure that in the case of terrorism where we have massive destruction uh that could not be of course uh in in the cost of premiums and so when you have these massive destructive hurricanes etc uh the insurance companies have to get some support in order to ensure that we can rebuild and reconstruct it so we're working on all these issues and of course health care is at the top of our agenda dealing with making sure there's affordable health care for everybody and we've got to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and so when you add that to uh what we'd like to have moving in the Congress uh dealing with the repair of our infrastructure and of course some of the other issues a lot is going on it just does not get covered  well I am very very optimistic about um the two sides coming together around prescription drugs it's a matter of how many and what drugs are going to be covered uh I think there are some of us who would like to see a lot more drugs a given consideration uh to be negotiated and right now we're still working on what drugs and how many well I'm particularly interested in Alzheimer's for a number of reasons uh of course it's very difficult sometimes to get beyond those areas where you uh are working in your committee I have financial services and that's a huge responsibility where we're dealing with all of Wall Street we're dealing with private equity we're dealing with hedge funds we're dealing with oversight of all of the agencies of government uh the SEC which is our cop on the block and the OCC and the Treasury and all of that but I said I had to find time to deal with a disease that's going to bankrupt America if in fact we can't get a handle on uh research and cure and so yes of course I think I and many families in America and all over the world uh are dealing with someone a relative of someone in their family friends who are the victims of dementia of Alzheimer's and in my own family my mother who eventually passed several years ago uh before passing had uh basically uh become the victim of Alzheimer's uh and of course I have friends and I have members of Congress who talked to me about what's going on in their families every day and it they're the sad stories about um children whose parents don't recognize them anymore after they've gotten to a certain advanced degree of Alzheimer's and there are those of course who have lost and their family members and of course we also have many of our younger people who are now uh the caregivers for both mother and father uh two people in the family and finding it difficult to go to work every day and be responsible for this care and it is uh absolutely a huge strain on some of the young people as a matter of fact one of my best friends who just passed her son was her care- caretaker and he died before she did the stress of it I think is what killed him uh he was very devoted to his mother uh he lived with her he took care of her and we were shocked when he passed and we could not believe that this young man uh had passed long before his mother had passed and so there's so many stories and yes in my family and other families all over the world and here in this country uh we have a disease that we've got to get a handle on and that requires that we spend a lot of money on research and we cannot uh hold back it's going to cost a lot of money but we must allocate that money we must look for private sources we must look for all the help that we can get to invest in the research that is so very necessary in order to get rid of uh Alzheimer's there is a cure possible I believe that okay well I sure did bring my notes because I want everybody to know uh we have a national plan as you know to address Alzheimer's disease for a cure for an effective treatment for Alzheimer's by 2025 that's our goal in order to do that we have to work very hard I've worked very hard on research funding in 2015 Alzheimer's research received about 586 million in funding year 2019 it is 2.3 billion so we have been successful in doing what we need to do to continue to educate the members of Congress and to get the appropriations increased significantly this year I've requested an additional 350 million increase in funding for a total appropriation for 2.65 billion in 2020 a total of 130 members of Congress signed on uh to the bill uh in support of it so we have tremendous support and I'm looking forward to the increase to two point six uh five million for 2020 well I'm excited about research and technology uh yes I was at the conference and I walked through uh I believe is that our Convention Center and I saw so many new ideas and new ways of talking about testing and of about patient care and so there's a lot going on and much of that is not reliant upon the money from federal government we have private industry who are spending tremendous dollars uh for their research efforts without the support from the federal government so I do believe that with the interest that I have seen and with the interest of uh so many who are anxious to find a cure uh that we will find one and that our goal is realistic well um you know when I think back about uh what I have seen and experienced as many people have seen an experience in their lifetime there was one time when we didn't know a lot about Alzheimer's we didn't know a lot about dementia and it was pretty acceptable as you grow old that somehow uh you were going to be uh disassociated uh that you were thought of as being crazy or that that's what happens uh at a certain age first thing we need to know is uh we experiencing Alzheimer's at a younger and younger age and there's so many families still that don't know that it is not acceptable to see mother or daddy or grandfather or grandmother somehow losing touch and do nothing about it to just think that that is supposed to happen and so we have to encourage and educate folks on testing and then there are others who when they begin to lose their memory in a substantial way and I don't want everybody to think about uh there isn't some loss of memory as you grow older and it is not always Alzheimer's just because you can't find the keys or you don't remember where you parked that happens to most of us yeah I know as a matter of fact I'm hesitant to go into the big parking garages anymore because I've experienced it so many times but I do think that jotting it down makes good sense so it's not that you know people should be so worried about that I think that there are folks many who even themselves begin to realize that something is wrong or if you're observant and of course just being observant does not mean that you have to do anything extraordinary just being with your family members and friends when you uh realize certain things I think that there should be an opportunity taken uh to address it in some way uh so we need to get the word out that it is okay to be tested that as a matter of fact I've been dealing with uh verifying a uh brain surgeon who talks about everything from nutrition uh to other health needs that should be taken care of that can be helpful in preventing or at least slowing down a bit uh and so I'm I'm very optimistic that if we can educate if we can get the word out that if we can help people to understand that testing is extremely important and for those people who have their yearly checkups ask your doctor about it find out what your doctor knows about it or if your doctor can give you a reference uh to speak with someone who's specializing in this disease so that they can take that information back and share it all of these things need to be done we need public service announcements and we need funding that helps support outreach and particularly into communities that are not yet connected uh because they're not on the internet they're not interacting uh with others uh they're confined uh inside the communities inside their homes we just need to do more to get people understanding that testing is extraordinarily important  well you're welcome is that it  I do I must say one thing before I go I want to thank the Milken Institute and I want to thank Mike Milken uh for not only addressing the economic concerns of out society but the health concerns this is what aspect of what the Institute is doing relative to health as you know they've been involved uh with cancer research and that has been so important and getting the word out in the way that the Milken Institute has helped to do has got men getting tested more and getting men understanding what they can do uh if in fact they become the victims of uh cancer and so I'm very pleased to be here sorry I can't spend more time but thank you Milken Institute so very much
