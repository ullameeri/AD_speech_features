but I've I’ve I latched on to it pretty much you know let me play some Glen okay here yeah yeah a guy that was married to my dad sister's name was Dick Bills and um but I was going to California on the way I stopped and realized that that works I went with the guy that was going to California but when I come back to to Albuquerque um I've to see my Aunt Judy and that's when I stopped in and I said oh boy I'd really like to you know and Judy and my aunt she once she got me into the band I was 16 I think or 16 years old that was that was the start of it we had a five day a week radio show and KOB the yeah a 50 stars of what Clear Channel that’s where I saw Elvis the first time he’s on The Farren Young Show featuring Elvis Presley that's all that was and oh and oh Farren poor Farren made a mistake man of having his special guest Elvis Presley going first whoo nobody I tell you friends everywhere nobody could follow Elvis Presley and I know you know  yeah well maybe God could follow him but it was um it was just awesome here's Farren Young singing hello old walls hello this is oh we want Elvis we want Elvis I have I never seen anything like that in my life Elvis Elvis Presley was it folks it's that was there and it’s it always will be probably oh yeah and Elvis being the the second in line so to speak feature it would be Farren Young show featuring Elvis Presley in little letters you know Elvis had his big after that it was just so I yes I'd a- I’d advise anybody boy if you got any musical talent at all it'll it'll come out somewhere get a guitar a mandolin or a fiddle or something and start doing it I was I was I went out with a friend of mine he had a it was a green car I know eh eh eh but I went after LA and I I went to a session that Jerry Naylor he was a guy that was a radio guy in Albuquerque and he had went out too and he um got me in and I got to see sessions and um um um my song Dooley session and I said wow man that's what I want to do I said I and I got in on that I moved to California and um started beating the the but I made some acquaintances thank God um um that that had again inlet to um the session guys and um I tried out for it and started doing that and that's what I did for for quite a few years well I did I did the sessions I played on all the records but um that was me going out and try playing bass and singing the high part and I was that was the hardest thing I believe I've ever done in show business eh eh you know it was just pat your head and rub your stomach oh my cover fell off that’s okay I don't pop my piece you know oh yeah I doesn't doesn't matter really but I like yeah I do like to play and these all these are great guitars I sure like them yeah they may be missing isn't when I leave eh eh eh yeah uh-huh and I did all the Dean Martin’s album if they hadn’t cut the whole thing but but the the Dean the Sinatra thing he just  came in he came in he did three three three takes two takes and a half actually you know and I'm sitting there looking at Sinatra like you know yeah a swooning cow because you couldn't take your eyes off of Frank Sinatra when he was singing and I get I it would be I think the the these people that are here today you know if if Frank Sinatra was singing he had that kind of charisma cuz and he he was the best singer I think he was the best pop singer in the world ever I was um watching the I did the Joey Bishop show when Joey started with a thing and and I just sat around and chatted with him for about 20 minutes and played songs sang and stuff like that and Tommy Smothers happened to have it on Joey's show and he saw me and I had played on their their albums um um well the album says that they did and anyway to make a long story short he said I didn't know you could sing like that or I said well you never asked me you know anyway Tommy was wanting to do us um um um a summer show so he made me he said can you talk and I said well sure I'm talking to you silly eh eh eh and Tommy them were funny Tommy Tommy Smothers was a funny funny man just and um he said you want to host it and I said yes and my manager was very pleased so it was was we and the the show was in this you know 8 o'clock Sunday night that's the prime spot for any television show and I got to do um 11 or 12 shows that summer shows well there hadn’t been anything like it like it on on TV um they had there there'd been stuff that were like it but not you know not on that scale because I had you know I'd have every good singer that I knew or a comedian or whatever I wanted them on the show because you've got to have talent on the show if you're gonna please an audience you know we we were lacking and if it weren’t for Tommy Smothers you know there probably wouldn't even be one now Tommy is the one that brought all that all that stuff in there wasn't a musical show on TV that I know of they'd have they’d have shows and specials and stuff like that but not not a weekly show six days a week you know and um Tommy did that that I wasn't acting that’s me oh you kidding me I'm just I just couldn't get it um and it was so slow you know y'all that's right I rode with general Kirby rapport and it would be an hour and a half before you would say anything else it wasn't I was I wasn't set out for that oh you know I was used to playing my guitar and doing the job and going home and I really it was it was actually acting was boring for me because I didn't do it that well well he knew that I would give him that push he needed to get his Oscar for the first time eh eh eh I said boy that John Wayne must be good fixed and up with our Glen there that was a good song I thought oh I tell you to get to work with John Wayne yeah I said what do I do he said just talk I said makes sense to me but I get over there and I would be so nervous it was my first movie and then almost the last one I had one more after that um but it was that I understand you want this report when you adrenaline comes in your system you don't know how high you talk I think is anybody here had that talk that happened to them it was yeah I wrote you don't Kirby one of it and it was just I mean I wouldn't if I had to choose over I wouldn't change a thing you know it’s I I'm I think I had my um shield up a long time ago for somebody trying to make me mad or get my goat or anything like that you know i just I just flat did not like acting that you know it was you do two lines and you sit around and wait for an hour and a half two hours aren't you or you wait till next week till they got back from that location maybe yeah it was just it was just something mhm click it right along and it's fun when you do something when you do something that you know how to do it's like you know it's like anybody if you know a mechanic or are you know even if you're picking cotton if you know how to do it well you can do it well oh yeah I didn't like that picking time yeah the vinyl is better you can't you couldn't fan yourself for them little old bitty ones boy that’s good song oh the song-wise you mean oh production there was a I just look Julian handle it Julian Raymond Julien Raymond I just said you know he's just I've I’ve you gave me all the songs and I look through them and I picked out the ones I wanted to do oh boy I don't know hundred probably 150 I don't know he he had me working yeah I was familiar with them but well look how they've held up all this time so they must be very good but you know good a good song if you got a good song and it it it will hold up um it doesn't matter if you and how you record it you know look at Gentle On My Mind with with Hartford and um the banjo and me and the rhythm section bingo here was this um big huge record Gentle On My Mind yeah Jimmy Webb got the award for that for being the most played song of the millennium eh eh eh of the millennium is said it's a long time ago um God God gives you life and you've got to do with it what you will and I I kind of rubbed his nose in the dirt for a while but um yeah I finally come to my senses and realize you know that you got a you got to do what's good and right and just and fair and um that's the way I try to live my life now and I my darling wife Kim I I'll give her the ring she was yeah got three got two boys and a girl and um they're all and Ashley's now and she's the  last one in college but actually put them through college the boys didn't I said well you're gonna go through high school I thought if you don't I'll cut the grub off but anyway if we just it's it's amazing you know I prayed and prayed for the relationship with somebody that would work cause I'd went through some but God knows and here come here come my darling and that was it oh it's it didn't it didn't affect me because I acknowledged it I was very stupid you know um somebody said that he said oh I'm a stupid somebody said that one time I was there was some guy that we had lost almost everything and he said oh it was a it was a Mexican guy and he said oh I'm a stupid and that's why I mind I my whole time through there I didn't know I just kind of woke up one day and saw what kind of a predicament that I was in you know and I didn't know if I would if I had the willpower to do it so I moved to Phoenix Arizona and um we started going to church with the me and the family and um it it just flat worked out I moved back to Phoenix Arizona yeah I live in Malibu now make me yeah and make me stronger and you know if if the people can take you know songwriters or you know singers um the people have been in the business when they can you can always get something from them you know and you can stand the Jesus song wow when I heard that I said that's it it's a that's a guy that's pleading and what that is really Jesus help me find my special place help me find my niche and it was it's a prayer that's what it is and the guy put some music to it yeah these days a good song boy howdy probably well I hope not end yet I hope everybody has the time of their life you know God gave us an incredible life here on this earth to to live and um you know a lot of us get on the wrong road some time but who doesn't get lost you know once in your life or twice in your life third time is charm probably I hope I never face it I sigh I I did the songs because every every song in there tells something and they're just they've that's when the the guys were really writing and coming out of their heart and especially the Jesus help me find my final place know yeah boy that's a good song well Glen didn't say I would grow old I'll grow older with you I really am Julianne Ryman I'm so I'm I'm I'm indebted to him for a while but I got my credits good
