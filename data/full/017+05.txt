there are a lot of people in it I've got this theory at the moment ever since the Marigold Hotel they've done a sort of archeological dig to dig up very old actors because it might be a bit of something in them left so they've gone around looking for it they're putting up I know I know I know but and also I'm not a baby boomer I boomed a long time before the baby boomers no dummy everybody knows now I mean us all everybody asks me I'm nearly eight two I'm 81  no I don't know you've been specs darling what ever age you want it's only because it's only because they do these little milestones with us and say you're going to be forty and people go uh I should I thought that you should if you didn't know how old you were you had no idea at all we'd probably all feel you are so right I've had it I I I and also the other thing is there's another thing but once once you get to 80 doesn't matter what your career's been like it doesn't matter how mediocre crap uh sorry sorry thing you've been over the years you get to 80 and I just said God if you can use a knife and fork they go isn't she amazing  they do because isn't she marvellous well no don't don't I mean uh uh this they they do it it's like the clap I don't oh no that is nonsense I think it I think it's complete nonsense I it just I mean some people are born old aren't they I mean they are you get you get old children even and you get you know very little but oldish children and then you get other people who aren't it's just the way they are you two will never be old because you'll still be giggling into your grave going down going please don't make me laugh no I mean what what no no I'm I'm  I am the laziest person I tell you I do swim a bit quite often I swim with two noodles under my arm watching television so that cancels that out I also do things like saying no I'm not going to drink I'm not having a date for next month and then I will go out and have 15 cousin pastas which I have done oh oh my god how did you know that I buy dinner but uh we had rather hectic night my friends and I and the next day I went to the decorative arts and I bought this enormous mirror well my flat in Covent Garden is quite tiny I don't I don't know what I was like I was living a Versailles or what when it arrived through it Hilary said to me how could how could you buy a mirror that size and I thought it's 15 cosmopolitan so that's what they it was obviously a hack oh hate it we've got a field we we own a field the other day I had to ask them how they open the gate into it I've never been in it oh city yes darling Govent Garden I live in Covent Garden and I'm always there I mean I can nip down down Bond Street into shops into Canary Street in the unit I walk miles put me in the country and I go green dripping stuff and everything I go is is I can't walk there suddenly they go you can walk when you have to go oh my god there's a sale at you know oh god gotta get there gotta get there on time and you can't you see we take the dog out no it's I saw my ankles a bit funny I cannot all uh I've got this really bad pain uh the humidity was silly I mean I'm not a drip dry person I was I just dripped and everything and I mean Miriam looked wonderful there was this thing that looked like a sort of uh sort of melted trifle walking around which was me I I got ill right at the beginning they got ill later on so the majority of the time I was in India I spent sitting in bed not the majority I was there but in bed with my iPad going oh I found Jenny Marie I'm honest to god I found woman's R and I got very excited they were seeing temples they were visiting things they were sitting to what was I doing I think I've got the arches I mean I uh I needn't have gone to India and then I did have this vision that I thought when I was ill I thought I know what they're going to do with me it's going to be the last episodes and they going to shove me down the Ganges they're going to say goodbye mother she died just fish her off so we've got a great end to the series there she goes floating down the Ganges
