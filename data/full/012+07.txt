it’s an empirical me um first the first shot that showed that the um paper trails in the sky in a globalised world you know how uh you you get habits form and you do the same thing in China you do here you have the same franchises in China you have you have here same looking downtowns in a Qatar as you have in Detroit um not quite that’s right it’s not quite um Qatar’s beginning to rival showing how in wackiness of the profile of the downtown anyway um so globalisation is really a good thing I love my iPhone I love the interconnection I have with with you or with Henrieqe everywhere and um when Ed talks about my background in New Mexico it’s looking at the sky a lot of a great part of the time imagining where those contours go because I on I was jessled all of the time working from Albuquerque it isn’t easy LAX is one of my hubs or and or the down the through the years that’s been one so um but because of that that that that ease ease of uh both digital communication and physical travel it’s really important to make a place look like a place a building a building look like the place where it belongs looks like it grew from the place and has a DNA of the place in some way instead of the the um the habit showing up different in different guises slightly different guises in different places so that connection to Mexico is really important because it was so powerful with the uh inescapable force of the climate there like here and the uh the the the cultural depth the cultural strata you can see the Anassasie runes Paul show some other shots of the um early stuff so that’s right in Albuquerque that’s landing on my flight from LA next to Albuquerque a couple of weeks ago and that’s a real Puerco that in that that almons cloud humming over the desert like this morning here next and then an early project which really came from the earth the uh Lanouse project was adobe literally adobe earth architecture one of the largest ones in the in the world actually in terms of new work for um a contemporary client developer actually and uh lead to a lot of recognition suddenly which was unexpected had an exhibition in uh Santa Pombidur on Earth architecture that it was foc- focussing on that building so that connection to the Earth and to the desert in a particularised way in New Mexico they have is the uh the con- the connection we’re speaking of and that and that regionalism became portable for anywhere I go you know I look at where the sun is where the winds come from the cultural memory of a place and try to deal with that build it in.
