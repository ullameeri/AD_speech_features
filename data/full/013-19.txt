well I try to be but watch my watch my hand yes I do I I've never seen it so I don’t know yes but the uh uh the the problem we are not always in the same place when the show’s going on the air little I always know where that's going to be on I we were doing we’d kept and I both did in a hotel a couple of weeks ago and we were on the air I didn't know whenever somebody's oh I don’t we had so many kids no I tell you neither you on I gotta tell you something we’ve had we’ve had fans and uh what’s the name of the producer that came to New York to join us the screening in New York Noah’s sitting over here sorry uh he had brought kids yeah Allen he brought his children he brought two little kids with him uh uh how you got him Halary Gotendy yes though she asked the producer he came to see the picture right he brought his kids with him kids scream they loved it seven and ten totally understood it totally completely related to it because of the memory of it they never did nope nope nope not and never does well then they came around being vulgar and have grown up and mature and adult but they never did no I never heard I never heard never heard honestly swear on my life part of it because their old man was so vulgar no I must I must say though I I think that why I think they’re not that that you may have made a mistake in observation on it Leta was because children today still want things desperately they still want certain they want a pacman game they want uh uh a computing they want a uh a bicycle three wheel motors or whatever and they really it's a substitute we be going the same thing as a gift today and kids really understand that yes I did yeah dogs I had to have dogs no I love dogs I love dogs it’s that these particular hounds they much rather than I think they were not well trained and wouldn’t do it you see you have to psychologically dealing with animals you must be very very uh precise precise about what you do in other words you have starve them if you want them to do something you have to starve them then reward them so I said the keeper I said you know we’re more than downside we’re down the Midwest down I mean down uh uh Arkansas or somewhere and he's oh I go got a red ball hounds yeah and uh I said what they won’t do what we want so you got to starve them right and we starved them for a week and we’ll feed them on Friday we’ll feed them on Monday and he said okay yeah that's good idea and I said then I got a double overcoat which we’ll shove up with hamburger and they'll the follow me right he said oh yeah good we came in Monday doesn’t do a damn thing they just wondered around I said what's the matter didn’t you starve them he said he said no they’re hounds they were hauling all over the weekend he said I had to feed them great whatever happens well the truth’s been out oh dogs you can’t talk to these you can talk to kids but you can’t talk to dogs you know they’re terrible wonderful wonderful he’s a wonderful actor he shows up and he knows his line and he’s wonderful he’s very creative young actor he’s terrific oh I was about 20 I guess 18 20 years old well it’s the contribution that an actor makes well you see it’s it’s it's not it's not as simple as that it's not that’s that's oversimplification a screenwriter a director and an actor all reading the same script approach a scene with three totally different movies running in their head am I clear the screenwriters has one movie running that is written this character that really is his brother he hasn’t told anybody the actor who’s cast looks nothing like his brother so he can hardly relate to what the actor is doing the director says I know that person I know that person I used to live with him and I understand what he's doing because he's doing it because of this because of this has only got so much to do with what the actor’s saying because he’s oh I hate this oh yeah I know him I know him well and I want him to comment on it because I think it illegal three different movies I do reconcile that's the fun of course of course the actor does what he does the director says oh Jesus I I haven’t seen that movie well that’s a very simple problem it is what happened was became the script was said and the father uh swears blue streak and burns up the air I said to Bob quite what I said what swearing where is the swearing you’re right you’re right no no so we called gi- he said I said how we gonna do this into the PG movie or do a movie that that does not uh use the big words the four letters right and he said oh boy so he called Jean and Jean Shepard came in and he wrote a bunch of yours using form of consonants that sound like the words like to go and dig all doc and tickle dock and cocker shed you know yeah whatever those were the words that sound like but they aren’t right so I recorded those things four times because I didn’t get the right presence for them coming out my cellar and uh it sounds terrible you say what is it what’s he what’s he is he saying those things can’t talk about it I can’t talk about no by contract I can’t but I start next Thursday or next week I start what 3 hour uh CBS film for CBS called I hope so are you well you see me playing an Australian well I was doctor Kids well I’m trying to get it up actually
