I think going to the different churches gave me a lot better focus of a man's religion quotient and um and um overall feel of of  of music going to see the black churches who and I used to go over there with uncle boo and we’ll all set up and look in wonder and and and just enjoy them you know I'm glad if they're I'm glad I got to see that because um it helped me um want to do something besides um you know country I found out real quick that it was lighter than pulling a cotton sacks or ploughing it was strange one thing left another next thing you know she's she's pregnant so we get married and the baby was the baby didn't make it he was a boy the marriage didn't last poof it was over with but she got pregnant again you know she did what her mother said so it was instant divorce you know cuz I'm working I'm playing six nights a week you know and we had a radio show five days a week in Albuquerque was like the Farren Young Show came through with special guest star Elvis Presley and it was it was so dynamic it was so it was just you could not sit still uh it was so much better than the big band stuff it was it was um it was the best thing I'd ever seen anybody do live that they had that much energy and I went up there in the open for The Doors I went up there with Glen and his guitar on and did Turn Around Look At Me and open for The Doors and got very nice polite applause from this pregnant touch of teenagers there's about 12 musicians called a Wrecking Crew maybe 15 and we'd go from one session to the other all that changes was the song title and the chord progression I'll never forget they called me on a Wednesday for ur gig on I think was Saturday night uh inDallas and I said I said sure I will play and and and um Mike Love and Carl said that we want you to play bass and sing Brian's part I’m like wow I don't even know the words they said it won't matter cause it's so loud anyway they  tried to put me to country mode you know I said I'm a jazz player man you know eh eh eh um I was doing studio work so I I really didn't care I was very pleased for I was I mean you know $100,000 in was a million dollars today Jimmy wrote it as a ballad and Don Ho did it as a ballad you know well I you know I thought I never would finish singing it it was like getting up and going ploughing I was totally out of my element and I was just like a fish out of water and what God has let me do since I've been on this earth has just been phenomenal to me because I didn't plan any of it I just kind of took it in stride you know well I'll tell ya my old lady introduced me to cocaine and that that did it well no I was trying to I tried to hide it oh yes I didn't hide it it definitely makes a liar out of you cocaine is terrible drug I couldn't find good songs for a while and then I heard Larry Weiss is Rhinestone Cowboy on the radio and that just blew me away I just said oh god that’s my song yeah that was the sixth song in history to go number one country rock and pop cause that's what to charts were then guess who had the first five Elvis eh eh eh he had the first five songs to go country rock and pop all it's the same in the same way Elvis and I were the only guys to ever do that the icing on the cake was are you gonna release that stupid cowboy song as a single which was Rhinestone Cowboy I come and she'd critique of my music and I didn't like it at all at first sax was going but that's how he heard it you know and I heard it totally different I've got two marriages and Mike and and Sarah Davis is split up Billie and I was split up so Sarah and I got together we got married and she travelled everywhere with me I was probably the only drunk preacher on the planet or I’d get high on cocaine that get that Bible out in this read read read read read  you know here I was being a good old boy Glen I was just being as honest as I do knew how to be and uh she was lying to me and then that’ll make me mad eh eh I said I got to talk to her and finally I looked her right in the eye and I said goodbye I had a the doctor in Vegas always confided in doctor Gotham he’s great he was Elvis's doctor too he told me he said Glen if you don't stop doing this you're gonna die I think I've probably just quit letting God run my life I had to reach up to touch bottom I was looking for a way I was looking for help there wasn't no body no expert on this planet could help me it has to come from your own soul it has to come from your own inside it took time to get off the booze I don't know people say people are alcoholics or when they are you know I guess I was I was what you could call an alcoholic at the time well you don't you don’t do it for just people to dance to you know there are shut-ins out there that like to listen to good music it's like I awakened from a bad dream ain't nothing you can do about it now you know no pride was built now go on with your life and do what you can to help it's like I've asked God for forgiveness he's forgiven me the truth the truth will set you free but if I had to go drag myself to hell again then I wouldn't I wouldn't drag as many people with me I don't think
