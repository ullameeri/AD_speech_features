well she is a very special lady here's my fate I moved to Albuquerque New Mexico I went to work in my uncle's band and um I don’t know they’ve they knock on him they never invited me stay in the house so I got a motel room right and about a week later this large man and his wife bought this he was six foot six weighed about 340 bought the motel and he'd ran the club Chesterfield across the street where I had work but they didn't hadn't owned it when I was working there with my uncle they bought the motel for an investment they ran the motel well his wife was Miss tiny she was I don't know she's a 250-pound gal and strong I mean she's 77 now and she runs me ragged and at that time and she looked on the on the registration and she said you're from Delight Arkansas and I said well yes I am I said you know anybody in Delight she said hey I know all 38 of them and come to here's how my faith works she had went to school every day of her life with my mother so I had me a mother hand there man and that's really where I learned about 40 years of life in about four years living with that lady oh very much advice she give me yeah her daughter hear d- she and her daughter adopt she'd adopted a daughter the same age as that I that I was of course she'd had her since she was a baby she's really a great lady man she took this little baby and it was it had some kind of you know the strawberry type of face and her and her husband took that baby the Mayo Clinic cleared it up and she's she's a beautiful woman today Carol she lives in New York and Miss tiny said you don't you and my daughter to be the best friend she said but if you mess around with her said I'll break your damn head now you understand that don't you and I said yes ma'am I do sure she scared me but she could set on you and wear you out if she so desired she's a widow now Dick and she doesn't have a living relative well so so be it they’re not they’re not tears of sorrow though yeah they’re there’s a difference you know I feel sorry for them they still haven't learned take my I went to um my daughter got married in February and um by my first marriage and um I asked her I just looked her right in the eye and I said are you being a good woman and she said yes I am finally and I said that's great man you know I said that's really super that's it because you're not you know I would just spit on you because I don’t know why I feel that way now Dick um I wouldn't spit on you it's a stupid remark but yes I had rather do that who am I to judge you know it's like why would I ta- ta- take revenge you know or it's anyone that proves the point with physical strength there you know I watched the dating game or the newlywed game on TV you know that and I look at those people I say my God oh yeah well you didn't do that and they're on nationwide TV here there and you see such pettiness and well not all of them naturally but some it's one trying to cover up their own insecurities I think in other words if you've got something within you it's been you're gonna see it and you're gonna see it in the other people if you hadn't got something in you you don't see it that's where innocence is in other words you could hurt me because I'm I'm open to you I'm glass to you I don't lie to you and I don't BS you and if I did you would probably know it you'd probably see a change in Glen Campbell but if you ever did see the change that change would be constant also I don't I would I would love you always but I don't have to like you and I don't have to associate with you uh why should you hate Ruth Gordon said the greatest line I ever heard when she's 82 years old she said I found out the only thing that's bothered me in my life is because I hated something or somebody she said don't hate nothing you don't have to like it you don't have to associate with it you don't have to comment on it it's like I was commenting you know who's commenting about the situation with the Vietnamese people coming in or the immigration coming in I mean I can't do nothing about that so why should I let it bother me why should I say boy this these people shouldn't be doing this that's bull people who do those things are just they're afraid I guess I don't know hell let them in deal with it when they get here my children will take care of me yes oh yeah I don't lie to them they’ll know they'll know when they grow up they don't have they don’t like me now probably I don't know because of the situation the way it is yes because they'll realize that I didn't do those things that they were heard about because I haven't I haven't lied to them I if they want anything I say now uh-huh I give him the necessities and I tell them and call me I'm your father communicate with me I don't lie to you and if I will not punish you but I said if you do if you steal and you lie on your cheat yes I will not to spare the rod I'll take my belt off and I'll wear your butt out and that they know that and I don't care if they're 20 my my brother came home with three C camps one time he was 18 I'll never forget it I was about this high remember I don't know what the three see camp they were something during during the war and that's it Wayne go hook up the meals let's go to town when he says think you’ll have one of the other kids do it dad I'm grown up now and dad looked at him and says go hook up the mules and Wayne said well let's put on the boxing gloves right so that air was kept 14 ounce boxing gloves for us to fight because there's so many kids right he's always getting in fights I learned that the hard way because I was a youngest boy and always got the hell beat out of me you know and so they dad said get him and Wayne was funk funk funk and daddy hit him it felt like a mule kicking a barn down knocked him colder than a wave and Carrie my mother mother said you've killed him you’ve killed him and daddy says no he went poured water on him and said now go hook up the mule see from inception had we done what our father told us everybody done what her father told us everything would probably be equal right now between all mankind then you find once you know something once you commit to something and when you know within yourself that something is wrong it'll it'll it's bad for you if you do it this is why people who live with so much anger within themselves is that they cannot control their own emotions but smoking that's the one thing daddy I mean because I ever since like I was able to roll up with some corn silk men and smoke it at coffee grounds or a grapevine you know when you were just a kid I got a kick out of it about I didn't know what I was doing but but I think that's why the grass laws in the different states in the United States are just totally asinine there's no nicotine or no tar and grass Alaska's grass laws you can grow your own grass I know this is what I mean this is where the funny catch of it is the governor of a governor of Alaska said that here's this you can only probably grow between June and the end of July you know it’ll get about that high no but they've been there’s some great greenhouses in Alaska man and and then and the marijuana laws you can give it to your friends you can grow five acres but if you're caught buying or selling it's 15 years in the slammer I witch I would go along with any time that way you're forced to share and you're forced not to make a profit off of something that is illegal supposedly this is not illegal this will kill you I love to smoke grass I just wish it didn't get you high like the taste of it you know and I do occasionally and not to me anybody that is ignorant enough on any kind of laws that they're laid down like in Nevada for instance if you got a joint on you in Nevada you can get 20 years in Nevada in California you'll get $100 fine to me that's silly boy I mean there's got to be there's so much disunity but in the States and concerning laws and concerning honesty like the kid in Missouri they gave him seven years cause he had two joints on him and he was supporting his mother and father who were blind and they put him in the slammer for seven years that's not justice and they let somebody at these these three kids in Vegas here that that killed that old woman last year and stole her purse got five years probation and not one day in jail that ain’t justice no no you don't have to it's because that's not the authority in Washington DC they're supposed to be the authority of the nation we live under if you don't like the authority of a state you can live under you can move to another state you understand what I'm saying no I'm for the cause of what I stand for and why hope I can't do nothing about it often I have pondered
