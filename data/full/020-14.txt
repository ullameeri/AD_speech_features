looking at the Kennedys I make an interesting comparison first Edward Kennedy was the best politician of the three he is the best politician he’s gregarious he’s warm he loves it uh John Kennedy on the other hand uh was quite a shy person really uh it was not easy for him to get out and shake hands and all of the rest he did it very well it wasn’t easy for him he was a quite private person uh I would say that Bobby Kennedy on the other hand well I I would compare him as Alice Longworth used to as he he was like 17th century Jesuit priest passionate uh uh one of uh who broke no opposition very intelligent and so forth oh yes I can do it you know there’re just terrible book out on it it’s a terrible book I read it oh no terrible book I it gets a great review from uh Clifton it’s a book of the month unbelievable shit it makes him feel like god damn animal of course he was he was a man there’s no question in my mind that in this century the three greatest politicians acting politicians were Theodor Rosevelt Franklin D Rosevelt and Linden Johnson nobody else of their president was in their league as political operators listen I don’t want a president uh who’s warm on the outside and warm on the inside too I want one that’s warm on the outside and I want one who when the tough decisions are made is cold and tough and will make the right decision without uh fear of failure President Eisenhower was loyal too uh I must say uh he uh but but he believed you know he was a military man and he believed that people who are subordinates should carry out what the chief wants uh I reme- I never forgot uh that perhaps the man that Eisenhower and many European uh people who have talked to me believe was perhaps the greatest chief of staff in the World War Two was Beadle Smith general Beadle Smith and Beadle Smith this was afterwards was a neighbour of mine in Spring Valley he came in one day and and we’d had a couple of drinks and tears were coming down he was not well at the time and he he said well you know I was just Ike’s brat boy Ike always had a brat boy and he says that’s what you are well it didn’t bother me a bit that was my job a vice president a member of the cabinet a member of congress who’s a member of the president’s party he should always consider that he is dispensable and  should do what the man wants uh to carry out the policy because otherwise the man’s gotta get down there in the rain what happened to Richard Nixon when Eisenhower was President be bad for me uh wouldn’t matter too much perhaps to the country what happened to him would be disastrous
