well I have a lot of of questions um I've got notes of them here which I will consult if I may from time to time uh all right I I I and uh I'll just start with one uh that interests me and we'll see where we we go because I there's a lot that I would like to ask uh it's about the word experience which you sometimes use in your writings as uh representing something which you think we should in some sense overcome and you seem to uh connect the idea of experience with the notion of uh preconceived attitudes or dogmas or beliefs uh which uh impede uh a kind of being which you would connect with uh with a creative present existence now I don't entirely understand this uh I it seems to me that it just would be impossible uh entirely to uh to discount or escape from experience but I'd like just a stick to the to the term experience because it's such a very um perhaps there's a very particular sense you want to attach you it's such a very general word it seems to describe the continuity of consciousness which is simply characteristic of being human but perhaps you could say something about that you mean imagining it well this is a rather special sort of experience isn’t it well this is a um um a difficult question about how one is going to use the concept because if the world experience in English it describes something fairly vague it it couldn't mean it could mean either you say I had a strange experience yesterday or it can mean the continuity of your conscious life and your relationship to our past or it can mean something momentary but I I think what you are wanting to mean that is something which collects your past as it were uh and I I at one point I think you described desire as experience whereas love is not experience but could you just explain what the distinction is you say who is who is the experiencer well this is a difficult question true isn't it I mean if one were to ask a passerby on the street I mean he will say the individual yes these experiences belong to me so they are my experiences but they but then I mean if one were to pursue the matter beyond that kind of answer one might say well of course one must distinguish between different kinds of experience and um one would then think I mean let's say I could think of say three kinds immediately I mean that there's the experience of my past life you say of somebody he's an experienced man meaning he's had a lot of a lot of experiences experience is just the continuity of my consciousness uh going way into the past well then this is to let's pursue the matter then in this way that one would say well my consciousness differs at different times I mean it would be and the word experience I would think would differ whether you are talking about uh just ordinary uh life when say you're as a way imposing let's put it this way that partly you are sort of imposing yourself on the world and you'll say I'm doing this I'm doing that and this would be perhaps experience but also there might be an experience where you won't really present well I would think that people behalf what I'd call selfless experience uh um when they're well for instance when they're um looking at a great work of art um or I'm not sure about whether if they would somebody they love very much one could say this perhaps I think these two cases are very different but what what do you how where would you  well we would normally say say wouldn't we because um one we believe in the continuity of an individual person which of course is a well again we would usually say so because um one uh you could say I order my thoughts I mean I then this assumes that I am deciding to coll- I collect my thoughts we have such a phrase I’m sure well let's make a distinction here between ordinary language where one speaks about I mean in a law court or something somebody's responsible for something they've done even they they can't say well I'm a different person now or something I mean there's an ordinary sense of the continuity of the individual and somebody being the subject uh but leaving that aside uh I mean one doesn't have to be a philosopher or hold a religious view to think that the one is dividend one is a divided being and uh an there’s there are times when one part of you disapproves of another part so well nothing could be more fundamental yes I mean the the the this seems to be the nature of the real world that there is this difference yes this would follow in that if you if you condemn yourself for doing something then you are divided well if if this is an appeal to uh the word experience comes up to it my mind if this is appeal to  how I think about myself uh I would say um leaving aside the common sense or ordinary language view uh sometimes yes and sometimes no I mean that sometimes one is consciously uh judging oneself dividing oneself sometimes there's nothing except a single something rather single being or something yes well it sometimes seems so well I would have thought that it is and it isn't uh there's something uh there’s two two things that you say uh in what I have read and what I understood from our last conversation uh two perhaps I can put it this way there are two things which you seem to me to say which I don't understand how they connect or um are or harmonize I mean one of the things is I think that you uh which I liked very much you said that if I think that I am if I condemn myself if I think if I think well put it this way if I think that I am envious say well now the word envious suggests something which is bad so when one’s not to be envious perhaps uh if I say this I will start not in a kind of ideal self it doesn't exist but in my real being which is the envious person uh I feel great sympathy with this but then you also say that um there's no process I mean that I must be good not become good that the idea of becoming good is in somewhere an illusion now perhaps you could explain I mean it seems to me that in the one case you're suggesting that I must start from a guru which is a long way from my conclusion from my conclusion would be come unenvious the other way you're saying that uh there is no process of becoming  yes well this is what I don’t understand at all but do you you don't uh dispute this I mean you don't reject this go on well I I find though if you're asking me would I agree with that I I I'm not sure I mean I I think that I think we think about good and bad in in several different ways don't we we think of bad grading into good as if it were a spectrum was a goodness is here say a continuum continuum we also think I think if good as being if we think of it as perfection being really outside the world yes well let’s say good man then well yes if some people would say that they're opposites which exist in relation to each other well there's a very different between a bad man and a good man so in that sense they are very different on the other hand in a human being good and bad are gradient to each other and sometimes you don't know which is which I mean in ordinary fallen human conditions of course love often occasions hate but you say love is not related to hate uh you mean that it's an entirely different kind of concept wait a minute let me ask a supplemented question would you say the same about love and desire if we took the tho those two words you would you regard desire as something connected with psychological becoming yes and love is well now how does this different thing uh come to one I mean I might say well why why should it concern me what am I to do this yes you're using the word love in in a ideal sense which is unusual the sort of the psychological being so yes but this comes back to your saying that you don't experience love the way in which you experience desire but if I just I mean if I'm loving I mean uh better day again let's put this aside that in ordinary parlance um you speak of jealous love or something well that’s not what we're talking one's talking about some sort of absolute or I can't really think of the right word here but then I mean if I say well I I dearly love somebody and some as might one might say not a bad way but a good way as it were would you want to say this is not part of any psychological process in in my mind yes yes right yes I mean this I mean I'm I thought I was a Christian so there's a lot of of Christian way of looking in me although I don't believe in God or the divinity of Christ uh but I can see I mean in Christianity uh there would be an idea of divine love or perfect love which is something which we don't normally achieve at all perhaps but such well it doesn’t mean attachment attachment is is um attachment and desire I mean I think I mean what one would in ordinary power is called virtuous love I mean where you’re not hurting anybody else by loving this person and you're not possessive and unreasonable and so on uh there is attachment I mean there's uh inevitably if the person dies yes I I would I think I would take a different view as a convolution of desire I mean that is I seems to me I I would think that becoming good to use this phrase which perhaps you would want to exclude is a matter of purifying one's desires having good desires that is desiring something which is good now in loving somebody uh I would have felt that the element of desire uh was was present well there again one would say well there are low desires and there are high desire well desire is certainly connected with with the futuure it's connected with time  because I I desire something which is absent uh and I um but I mean let's take examples I mean I might desire to be frightfully rich or I might desire to study a subject and become good at it I mean in a situation where there’s no need well let's say all good at mathematics to acquire acquire knowledge well wouldn't this and I might say I love I love my subject uh I love what I’m studying well transmute yes I I'd rather use the word transmute yes and there's a process of transmuting and discipline or training or something like that yes education desire for riches is bad well uh whether there can be love without desire I'm not I'm not sure uh if one thinks perhaps of some kind of perfect love the notion of desire would have changed so much that perhaps you would have to exclude it but as an ordinary as a more ordinary but good level I mean if I desire to become well educated or something then this is a it's a tension it's a kind of tension between a condition which exists and a condition which does not exist well I I would I think I would they it or rejectthis question because I don't I don't see how one could explain what desire was without thinking of different kinds of desire how do you think and if someone says one is good and the other is bad you would come back to saying all the same it's desire yes I'm not sure that I would be able to understand it without without using that distinction but perhaps I can I mean let's shift our ground slightly um there's something behind what you're saying well all right well I think I’m going to withdraw that now and modify it by saying that I think that they should there might be some kind of desire which does not uh involve time before you are completely united with the object of your desire I mean I think this again would I mean something in Christian mysticism might say that the desire if you if you desire gold and if you're united with God I mean I don't know what this would be uh then uh your desire is fulfilled and becomes perfect love or something like that yes but you speak of desires if it's something but you want to overcome or set aside it’s not always a burden isi t I mean if if you des- if you desire something for instance if you're hungry and you know that you're going to have a good meal shortly then the attention of desire is pleasurable  but um but there’s something behind what you say which I I can’t get go on go on by sensation you don't mean bubbly sensation you don't mean that there’s actual physical concomitant but this is a kind of um imagery I mean you imagine yourself in the house say things like that so yes there is a kind of sensory aspect yes this doesn't mean of course that I mean one says one desires um one desires to be educated this does doesn't mean you're thinking about it all the time or having sensations you’re just means you're carrying on the life but there would be moments when you you have you you have a sensory um um experience of desire perhaps you imagine what it'll be like when your education is better or something like that yes but then you you just you say that love is is different from desire sorry say that again um yes all right uh uh I I would want to think that pure- purified desire uh this sorry this is the this introduces another topic it this one which I've let's just mentioned put it aside I I am also concerned with what you feel about motivationed energy I mean I think that desires a source of energy and good desire as a source of good energy but but let's take this idea of love being different I mean there's something this is seems to me a contrast between a process and something which is not a process yes it’s and you distinguish you say that there's something like you use some word like like creative being which is to do with the present and you would connect this with the possibility of love and truth whereas desires is is something restless which is outside this no ascetic it's probably the wrong Word here what what would you say it it's creative and it’s and it’s but the feeling of love is is a quite different feeling from feeling of desire so you're not excluding the sensory aspect of thought I don’t know you tell me but tell me if if love is a condition it is a human condition I mean it is a there is a state of being which is love or creative being which is love and so a person uh is sometimes in this condition uh are you suggesting that at that moment uh all the psychological stuff which that person consists of and has collected is uh somehow absent but still he must know what the object of his love is yes though I mean in a sense it isn't it isn't it isn't it because one I mean if one loves if one loves the person you love that person and not another one but it doesn't mean that you exclude anybody but still  no but it is selective if one could make the distinction afterall we’re not gonna love anybody I I mean um um perhaps God does and perhaps we should attempt to be God but what I mean you’ve just using God as a figure of speech there I mean the an ideal of would perhaps embrace everything but uh I mean to ask very very simple-minded questions I mean in the life uh let's say that you're interested in another person I mean afterall people come to you I mean I’m I’m coming to you yes but I I ask um well do you think there are certain times in one's life when one is uh one’s difficult to find the word well when one one is expressing or being loved but should should this be every moment of one's life in every moment of one’s life yes and you think if you see that no it would be imperfect love but let’s let’s let’s leave out imperfect love is is not love alright you won't let me use the word perfect or ideal but I'll use love in your sense then all right love then it does excludes šelf-interest yes but look then you see something that I very much want to find out uh and everybody wants to find out is how to change how to change how to become well it's connected with this because  how to move out of the situation of being envious yes as we were saying earlier the person is the envious person well yes but you could become less envious go on yes go on what do I do next though so so there’s a you who is watching the envy well watching a bird is quite different from other kinds of watching that’s well there there can be such watching yes it's difficult but well wait a minute we've we've got this envious person or oneself one is envious then uh one uh is aware of of the of the envy one watches it but just watching or being it if you like petting another consciously being you're envy would you accept that form of words yes so but you’re consciously I mean when you enviously do something thoughtlessly you’re not watching it you are expressing it but then there are moments perhaps when you’re watching it yes you’re attending to it yes in this case you're looking at envy but are you not making a judgment you are watching without judgement but then it's not the result of this attention that you envy disappears yes I like the word attention that you pay you attend uh in you would say some non-evaluating way or not making a moral judgement and you're not saying I ought not to be envious but but it is not I wouldn't say the purpose but certainly the result of this attention that the envy dissolves yes good good ok I mean I I understand this uh state of being yes but then is uh is not this then uh I mean this connects with my question about how do I change this is not yes well it is not that then this is if you like to use old-fashioned language a spiritual discipline I know you don’t like the word discipline either and this this state of attention uh would be something which um supposing somebody says or I say why not me but does this happen only when you're meditating for instance to use a word that you yourself use or does should it happen all the time all the time yes and this would coexist with one being a ticket collector or whatever ones job in life is that you could in fact the one the idea of living at different levels or different states must come in I think that there would be a state of your being which was this constant attention yes well it is a word that you use yourself yes well I this this seems to mean in in a sense unavoidable I don't know I mean I I mean I have been taught a system a meditation a long time ago and I have practiced and to some extent do practice something like meditation only in a very feeble way but  it does seem to me that um um there's something which is trying to do it better that no more more like you see you say when uh in meditation there there's no there's no duality I mean there’s no subject uh uh and I would say that something like this happens when in in experience of art uh alright okay well in I mean if I'm if I'm looking at a great picture uh if I'm really looking then I'm not there picture’s there yes this would be an image of love too wouldn’t it but in that you wouldn’t be there yes I think that in certain in a certain way of loving I mean do I mean unselfish love I mean this is difficult to talk about because love happens in time and you have to struggle and think and plan and do things for somebody you love but uh you would be uh really selfless in all that you're doing I mean you could be somebody in there doing things the self would would not be present the object of attention would be present  but it it seems to me you’d have to to try I mean you seem you give me the end but not the means no may I just quote a remark made by Kafka to the effect that there is there is no way there was only the end what we call the way is just messing about you would agree with this yes I think I mean I I see and I don't see as it were in the sense there isn't anything else but go on yes you mean is there an alternative state of being yes of course philosophers have always been worried about the difference in being and becoming and in um um Platonism and in Christian theology uh uh being is real and becoming is unreal uh and I feel something is this in in what you say but I don't want to mislead myself by thinking about anything else um I mean what I'm trying to picture what uh what what you uh are speaking of would be like I mean that one would let's say you're you are spending your time learning a language and you you don't know the irregular verbs today next week you will know the irregular verbs and this is a this is human life and unavoidable and and proper and quite right that you should learn the irregular verbs however uh during this time there's also you're also as we're tending to everything that you do in a yes uh now in a way in a particular manner yes I mean you're picturing um a possible human state yes the Word caught um suggests that there's some there’s freedom that's another word that you use of course freedom which is connected with truth and with love um and so um somebody comes to you saying well I'm in a trap how do I get out of the trap well I mean I I don't want to um well this is irrelevant I mean I don't want to get out of the trap in the sense that I I don't want to stop wanting next week to know the irregular verbs yes that’s that goes on yes but what I I also want uh say to achieve a state of being which is selfless and perhaps this might be the most important thing of all yes I mean I know that now I am no selfless I would like to become selfless but in the situation where everyone's looking at one's envious person for instance we agreed that one result of this attention would be that the end they would disappear so the self is changing but supposing I just attended to my envy and went on behaving enviously but with complete consciousness of what I was doing would that be a good stage I can’t be using the word good well one’s not postulating a kind of um um umone's not I think postulating condition which is totally unlike the human condition I don't know one’s one’s imagining it in a way in which human beings might be like now I am asking you yes go on well bat would this not result actually in my inhibiting it well why not I mean wouldn't it all right put it another way would wouldn't it be good for me uh to be simple to to inhibit my envy I feel envy but don’t express it yes alright but it it just meanwhile it might be better if I give it uh yes but you seem to me to exclude the element of training oneself uh I mean you you don't want you don't like the word discipline yes but what you're watching in this case is something precious it's an image it doesn't matter if it costs a million pounds it's something which is pictured as as absolutely precious uh now if I'm looking at my envy it's the opposite of a jewel it's something bad looking at picture is is a good example for um for me at any rate in trying to under- understand what your what your fundamental idea is here but I it still troubles me that you're suggesting what I would uh if I understand you think was a kind of ideal mode of being a real mode of being in which you're connected with reality but uh the remains the fact that one is not one is not in this stage one is sunk in illusion one is full of illusion but why why should I bother I mean put it in another way why why shouldn’t I just watch my if I if I’m a clever person I can watch my envy and uh uh be amused by it and continue to behave enviously but but don't you think wouldn't you wish if you saw somebody that you loved uh in a state of illusion wouldn't you wish for that person that they should change yes well then you are suggesting that he should change you're suggesting moral values well to call them illusions is already to make a whole lot of judgement yes well let's stick to the case of envy because that's fairly straightforward that somebody is consumed with envy by some people perhaps or absolutely he's got there so he’s better than me and so on and you will watch somebody like you say look why waste your energy and anxiety on something which is not deeply really important and that you should by doing it’s unreal yes alright yes but then you’ve you’ve taught them something well I know all good teachers refuse to call themselves teachers but go on but supposing somebody was in a completely harmonious state um with lots and lots of vices what we call vices losing their envious jealous violent angry could couldn't they be such a um um a harmoniously con- connected person supposing they are very successful in everything that they do I mean would you say that this was impossible well yes I mean I agree with you I mean and I think people assume rightly um that um that an evil man is in a state of conflict that um a good man is harmoniuos yes and an evil man has conflict well this then uh suggests that there’s something that the evil man has made a kind of mistake there's something unreal about what he believes about the world so then in making the distinction between good and bad one is making a distinction between so what you want to produce is a harmonious personality and you'll be prepared to drop the words good and bad then and use use the words harmony and disharmony in yes but still you're you’re still talking about good and evil in the sense in which we normally understand them you speak of the terrorists say I mean let's picture a very bad man not just an envious man but a very evil man somebody was cruel um then one would want uh this person to uh well I think we are reaching the end of our room per- perhaps we’ve reached it well I think I think I’d like to go on wiht this if if well perhaps we have to stop perhaps we could briefly go on after lunch well I I'm still trying to formulate some um fundamental question which I can't um grip or uh wri- entirely see at the moment the perhaps I could sort of walk round it a bit and ask one or two different sorts of questions for a moment uh you feel the idea of duty I think it is very yes the idea of duty I think is a fundamental one in uh most moral systems I mean the  philosophers argue about it but there it is people uh are taught when they are growing up their talk duties that they ought to tell the truth for instance and other things um um perhaps they have to always to tell the truth well you shy away from the idea of duty well alright well then but responsibilities then a sense of responsibility it would be a sense of duty well under some circumstances one could extend the two ideas in diferent directions but you would rather call it a sense of responsibility yes I mean one connects perhaps duty with uh a very definite things witch have to be done but but on the other händ if you some take something like a duty to tell the truth that's something so fundamental yes well they don't let’s worry then about about the word duty but this is a a a case where one's dealing with a an aspect of human life which is um which belongs to the continuity of life and uh would you say that just by that being so there it is an everyday notion which we um which is part of the decent moral continuity of of the society's life would you regard it as being essentially different from what we are talking about this morning from the the real thing and from love but I don't see quite where the division comes I mean there are I'm always trying to build up around you as it were structures which I want to see where uh the division comes between uh ordinary what we would call goodness or moral behavior and this fundamental thing well life life uh it has to be dealt with I mean every day you have to sort it out I think because it to unify it I mean to have a unitary I mean you seem to feel that we should have some kind of completely unitary selflessness which then isn't divisible but then I mean let's say the words words like truth and love uh yes this is is so if one is looking at it in a in a philosophical sense but somebody beauty is a more difficult concept for this purpose I at least I I feel uh what worries me is um the point of connection between uh the truth which is love the fundamental truth and ordinary conceptions of truth as in tell the truth yes well how does this connect with with you uh one of the things which I think you are very much concerned with its overcoming conflict and overcoming separatist thinking and so on uh this then does suggest that there's some um um you make these distinctions between desire and love love for instance uh and uh you then bring truth into the center by saying that love is truth um but this um doesn't seem to me to connect very easily and this is where the idea of my ideas about pur- purifying desire or something would come in the this doesn't connect very easily with ordinary moral life I mean it looks as if one would have two judgments of morality you'd say he's a good man in the ordinary sense of the word but is is an imperfect man in your sense of the word uh and uh isn't it important I can't think of a way of putting this for for you I'm thinking of you as someone wishing well to to men isn't it important for you to make connections well you want to go back to a metaphysical question right at the beginning yes I do yes this is your feeling that that we we must be right at the beginning all the time and um I mean I this I like this too in a way and what you say about new that's what you want is something new you use you use the word new that it's not the acquired collection if what on ehas but something new well there’s there's a sense of conflict or fragmented which is bad which means that we're fighting but there's also ordinary um discussive reason and uh how we set about getting to know things and acting in time which isn’t necessarily bad well yes but I I think there's a kind of um empirical ordinary answer to this so we can try and stop it by doing all sorts of things like people do when they talk to other people and uh yes a part I think you wouldn't deny this would you that part of uh what you want to communicate uh is uh something which would have practical effect in politics but this is this is partly uh it seems to me it's partly a it’s partly anempirical question in that you could say why we can find out why um a certain religion held um certain views at a certain time and um separated off and one could study Christianity in this way but one there's a sort of metaphysical question which I would think it's partly unanswerable I mean it's like saying why why why are there human beings I mean where one must say well I don't I don't know I mean some people who believe in God would say  God created the world yes I mean um um if it would still take empirical answer you're asking us a a kind of metaphysical question which in a way can’t be can’t be answered  well I think sorted self is fragmented and it seems to me in a sense uh unavoidably so I mean what we're doing now using a a natural language and and concepts and using words which we've learned to understand and so on this is something which depends on um um spreading out of interest to the world in many many different ways I mean the word discursive sort of covers this kind of of this kind of notion that uh the intellect has to spread itself out it has to emerge into language and so on it can't be a compact it can’t be one uh which many philosophers what they want to think that there’s there's a one but um in your rejection of um you won't allow you don't seem to me to allow to put it this way the redemption of the world I mean the bringing of the world into um into the center into into goodness in into truth and love because well yes but then one can't get rid of all fragmentation one's got to redeem it if you see what I mean get rid of bad fragmentation well again one there are many I mean if it takes if it takes Ireland for instance mean there are many reasons uh historical reasons why there is a conflict in Ireland but you're let- you're thinking of a much deeper much deeper thing which uh but it seems to me this this I can't oh well if somebody asked me that I mean I would say I I haven't I can't answer the metaphysical question what I can say is uh ought it not to be so and this uses the word ought which you don’t want uh that uh we have a conception of goodness uh which uh uh from which we spread as it were um all kinds of um thought and action to the world this is petting it very badly hoping that gradually we can make the world better and make it and remove conflict in the in the superficial sense and  in the deeper sense too and who can say what the futuure holds um but uh yes but what we can do now is something very limited really we can do something to ourselves and do something to a small number of people and we can also take part in politics which is the way of helping the world yes you you mean that if if you can do at other people can do it yes well there’s also eddect that one has a very limited amount of time in achieve this insight which is this way well except that you are a very unusual person but leaving that aside yes but what uh how does this um if somebody says well all right but you're just you you're by yourself I mean you you maybe showing what is a human potential you show what a human person could do yes but I I can't help putting the problem in terms of uh how much uh influence uh can can one have and if one is going to teach people don't let's think of um you know if you and me now but in anybody wants to influence people in order to bring about the end of this um um period of conflict and so on they have to involve themselves in persuasion in politics for instance and many people would say I mean many people do say that uh to worry about your own soul and whether uh you you are selfless or not is a waste of time they would simply go help other people go and stop people from suffering when when you think sorry I keep wanting to turn it around a bit so that I can get a bir more light um when you speak of overcoming conflict and overcoming suffering um ending yes um are you thinking of um a kind of uh I mean is this anything like what a a Buddhist would think of as Nirvana yes I I would understand something like this as meaning um that one uh is in a a selfless condition and the denial of the world is is the meaninglessness of um all these these ohter things which um um yes but then yes I mean um if if one thinks of um Plato’s image of the cave the that you're in the darkness and then gradually you move that into the light he also speaks about coming back into the cave uh uh by which I think he means that you find some kind of liberation for yourself but then you have to liberate everybody else as well it will affect a certain number of people yes certainly I was about to say that there are cases like like the life of Christ whether Christ's really existed as an historical man or uh the image of Christ has changed people’s lives yes alright but you would go on to say that nevertheless but we I think we have had great teachers who have had a great deal of influence who have uh as far as I can see advocated uh a kind of selflessness which is not unlike what you are speaking of but what is one to do I mean I just it doesn't seem to me that uh  we've come perhaps on to a slightly different kind of question uh uh a question about uh about influence and uh well yes that uh uh that again is something which we agree about that you have to do the thing yourself it's no good being told by somebody so I mean this is what this is something which I think theologians are realizing that you can't have God trust upon you I mean whatever uh the spiritual life is is something that you have to discover for yourself and appropriate for yourself yes well I don't myself see any answer to the problem of of uh how um the discovery of spiritual truths or whatever this may be um can change the world I I  that is I you perhaps have more hope for the world than I have well I I I agree with that too uh I mean if the world lost people who are concerned with what you're concernedwith I Ithink that it would lose its its centre in some way but then you you want to to put it sort of um bluntly as it were you want it to be more of such people but at the same time you reject um traditional methods of um for instance um uh ideas of duty ideas of asceticism and so on which have been as it were part of the training of people who achieve perhaps this state yes but youI think you've probably had a gift of grace of what a Christian would call grace which a lot of people haven't had that is that what um you achieve easily would be very very difficult to achieve for the majority of people yes I I I I agree en- en- entirely entirely with this um yes I I think I mean don't let's argue about the question of influence or politics because I can I I understand your position here I think I I would think uh I mean I would feel it it is perhaps important uh to try in certain ways to influence the one’s surroundings but I mean I know that this is full of difficulty and I'd rather in a way stick to the question we were worrying at this morning that I I don't quite see how to um find the um way of of enlightning myself on this subject uh it's it's partly to do with with with the question of time and fragmentation that time is fragmentation uh and yes yes free and and in the truth and and and and and love and not to be acquiring and not to be planning how I mean uh would one if one were in this um if one had this kind of insight or however you want to put it would would one know that one had it yes but you you do accept then that uh that there are two it seems to me that you are thinking in terms of two entirely different planes and I'm wanting to connect the two and you refuse this connection yes well there's a psychological plane then also which is yes what were you speaking off at the very start yes ye- yes I mean some I mean some kind of redemption I I’ve introduced the word redemption that we doesn’t matter of the um sort of psychological hurly-burly of one's mind I mean it seems to be can happen in a quite ordinary way I mean people wouldn't be puzzled by it would just be be a sort of natural function um yes I'm not thinking of being redeemed in the Christian sense no I just mean by redeemed I just mean that that something which is fragment it is drawn in using an image of a of a centre and of outlying parts uh I mean picture somebody what what I'm trying to to I’m and all the time trying to discover where just where this divide is that you make a divide between say the life of a very good man I mean let's think yes I mean ordinary ordinary very virtuous man who's been very unselfish in the ordinary sense and and and uh done a lot of good to people and so on between that life and um the only life of truth well why is it totally diferent I mean you can say it seems to my metaphysical uh remark to say it’s totally diferent I’m a really remarkable admired by by everybody in brackets as it were yes yes yes so uh you would uh think that if somebody was entirely absorbed in uh outward action asi t were um he wouldn’t be in the truth so a certainamount of of of fundamental quietness I mean that this could be compatible with doing uh leading an active life couldn’t it or yes I think I’m I believe in that silence too um yes and this would connect with with what you say about living in the present yes um and and timelessness yes uh I think any means that one adopts towards goodness it's likely to become a barrier um um it's likely to because one one seeks idols and I mean we are idol worshipers uh yes uh that one seeks um a consolation in the feeling that you're doing something yes but nevertheless doing it could could help you I mean well he needs to be congratulated I suppose he was prepared to say something like this because people don’t often admit it comes by a gift perhaps well if you say I don’t quite well of course I mean this is why I mean I I'm constantly wanting to say that the connection with one's daily life is is a fundamental idea I mean if somebody claimed to have this quietness but behaved badly in ordinary life I would be skeptical so that you're I think that what you're I mean um um my own thoughts on on this subject are I think influenced by Plato and uh I think or I feel perhaps that something you’re insisting on is the which he also insisted on was the absolute separateness the absolute separateness of the this idea of the timeless and eternal that it's it's quite separate from what we ordinarily think of as goodness which is a kind of idolatry yes and he uses the image of of destroying idols that you destroy images you destroy idols and you go on but of course he does picture life as a pilgrimage in a way which I think you don't you don't want to think because the idea of a pilgrimage itself yes and you are really picturing what  many spiritual people have thought of as the end of the journey I mean that you are at the end except that you want to insist that of course one is already um in a sense potentially at the end or that there is only yes I think there's a metaphysical I wouldn't call it assumption because it’s something I agree with I wouldn’t use the word assumption  yes but this this is a metaphysical assertion or a religioos only you wouldn't want to use the word religious because that might be misleading well yes I mean um um anything involving the idea of the God is of course already in a sense an idol yes so that the um um well I yes the the absoluteness of the division for you and and I I I think I would you mean I'm not quite sure between the ordinary process of life and this being in the truth uh which is is something which is uh lives in the present  in the way in which something eternal must live in the present if you see what I mean uh you you must insist on it being quite separate from the worldly idol well that that well yes that’s what people have always wanted which is not a continuation of time but which is quite different from the continuity of time yes well I think thinking about Plato I I come to some some understanding of of what you've been saying I think we understand here yeah well thank you very much
