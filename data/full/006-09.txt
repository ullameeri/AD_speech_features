thank you it's been great to be a part of the university and a part of this community yeah you know you can tell that I back down from competition and I just thought you might just overwhelm me but you'll have to admit you were relieved when I wouldn’t play you well I think the fact that I grew up on a dairy farm uh actually uh slept uh we had a log cabin was our home and I slept in a baby bed till I was six when I got out of that baby bed I said I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it and the discipline the work ethic uh parents that really taught us valuable life skills uh influenced the direction that I've taken in my life and I just knew them with three older brothers if I could survive that and milking cows every day you know cows don't take a day off hollering uh every now and then we get a day off right not very often but um just um to commit to something and to commit to it every day and I think that's what you see I think you see someone that's gone through that type of life and that's the way I think you live life I think my parents gave me two excellent examples of you can do anything you want to do you can have limited resources and find a way to be successful in life because it's about work and and I knew it's going to be hard they taught me that life's not easy it's difficult it's challenging but it's doable you can do it and they showed me by example and what better examples to have then two people that you love and admire and now more than anything I respect them oh absolutely complained all the time you know my sixteenth birthday party I missed because we had a forecast for rain you know farmers get up early in the morning they watch the ten o'clock news over in uh Middle Tennessee and they they plan their day and um I'd plan to to go to the country club I never got to go to Country Club very much and um we uh there was two of us celebrating the birthday there and I was going to meet up with all my classmates and my dad goes no no we have a thousand bales of straw on the ground you're gonna drive the tractor I remember being so mad Howard and I was oh absolutely not well I just I don't know that I grinned but uh I went forward with what I had to do and that was what I was expected to do I knew that was the exactly no we're going to work we got a job to do and I said yes sir I like my father I love my father I just I liked him um I liked him and and I admired him and and I loved him but he couldn't tell me he loved me and I couldn't tell him I loved him that we just didn't do that we didn't talk about you know I love you uh what you say to your kids and and what I say to Tyler every day but I knew he loved me I knew he loved me sure sure I wanted to hear it and you know it it it took me uh about 30 years to to to hear it but that was okay actually I was 22 years old I had four seniors that were 21 um it was just uh timing it was great timing for me well it wasn't like they're gonna pay me big bucks let’s face it Haward and I went there on a graduate assistantship and uh I I just graduated from UT Martin it asked me to come be the assistant to Margot Hudson who was a head coach a couple weeks later they called back and said uh that Margaret's going to work uh on her doctorate so she's taking a sabbatical and will you take the head job and I I was scared I'll be honest with you I I had no preparation I’d never run a practice never coached a day in my life and I felt like I needed some time think about it but then what an opportunity you know that's about believing anything's possible because it is and I had an opportunity and if I don't take that I mean I been to the University of Tennessee played volleyball when I was at Martin the campus seemed you know like a city to me uh and now here I am going in and becoming a head coach um I'm just glad that I had the courage I think you have to have the courage to step out and do things that are out of your comfort level or maybe people say you're not qualified to do but you figure out a way to get them done they are the best because we recruit winners I don't care how talented Pat Summitt might be I learn from my parents you surround yourself with winners in life winners are talented assistant coaches winners are talented student athletes and then you teach them and you work with them every day and you try to bring out the best in every person you come in contact with and I think you have to be the example for them and you have to set the I think first of all you you have to understand as a leader as a person in charge there is no job too small or too big I'll do anything if that means I have to to uh sweep the floors or clean up the locker room or set up the chairs which I had to do when I when I first arrived at UT I'll do that I will lead by example you may beat me but you won't outwork me I never want our assistants or our players to think that Coach is not into it as much as we are there's no shortcuts to success but I'm gonna work every day you know I'm I’m going to show them how committed I am say for example in recruiting you know I hire some of the best people in the business to come in and help us recruit the top student athletes in the game but they know if I ask coach to write a letter and make a phone call to get on an airplane first thing she's going to do is say when and where and let's go well obviously it's assembling a group of extremely talented people and trying to get them to have a team ego and understand it's all about the team and we do things for the good of the team and how I think you can best resolve any problems you might have a conflict is role play you're good at some things I'm good at some things so let's play to our strengths but we have to play together you know you you don't play basketball alone uh and and you'll a lot a lot of the people we recruit they're accustomed to taking 25 shots a game and now you tell me I get four come on coach but it's understanding that you can do other things other than score points to help us be a great team and then you become a great team player I think you have to understand yes the role of a follower and you know I I know for me growing up I I what I wasn't born a leader neither were you we followed other people but the one thing that I was always told from from my parents is understand it's important who you follow  because you win in life with people good people I it it hurts and it hurts me all over  um I just feel sick inside  well I did do you typically Halloran I've gone to bed for two three days keep my pyjamas on don't go out of the house well neighbours have seen me in my PJs occasionally um you know I don't want to be selfish uh with with the family I stay away from the team typically um I just hurt because you know I always can look back and say what if I had done this or what if we had managed this situation better maybe we could have won oh tremendous responsibility I mean our loss at Atlanta in the championship game I hurt so much for our players because this is one of the most enjoyable years of my career in a long time I feel it all over I do I love it no just a sense of satisfaction and and a great feeling for the people that made it happen um I I feel really um inspired um I I feel excited for for the players well in both cases it's about them it's about them I mean if if you coach and it's about you you shouldn't be in a leadership role for young people because you're teaching them about the value of teamwork and I'm part of their team I'm part of their team what I want to do as a leader is get them to take ownership but ultimately winning and losing um I just hurt for them or I'm proud for them uh initially I just want to talk I wanna talk I want to go back watch the tape I I I got to see it I got it I got to process it I got to get it out of my system um like the championship game I watch I had to watch it three times and the other morning I I turned it on and and I was working out and I thought forget it and move on probably not because he hadn't told me maybe he wants another championship or something what do you think my dad is he's very proud um I'm sure he sees a lot of himself right here and his daughter I was his fourth son actually but he's proud of me and I know it and he really Hallorin wanted me to retire in 84 and I came very close because I coached an Olympic team and our Tennessee team have played in the national championship game and actually competed with Southern Cal to the last five minutes had we won that game and won a gold medal in my mind I decided I would retire I am so thankful I didn't and I bet my father is too what do you think I think Tyler wants to be his own person but I think he he he really like most kids he wants the approval of those that he loves and so he wants me to work with him I go out in the afternoon and we work on his game and when I say great job I mean you know say thanks mom she so yes uh academically I'm very proud of what he's doing and and he's very committed he's probably more serious about his academics than I am but that that goes back to RB you know RB particularly a man supporting a woman well he's he's very secure in in who he is and what he does I think a lot of that comes from his mom uh Mae Summit who reminds me a lot of my mother and she was a very strong woman and and I think he had a role model to know that you know my mom is talented and she's strong and I think he wanted to marry someone like that and I'm I'm just excited it was me and and to to know that he is a big fan he loves a team um he obviously has to make sacrifices uh because of my schedule uh but he's just been you know he's been a great friend and he's been a tremendous supporter um and a great husband and a great father well I should tell you how much I respect you and you've inspired me and thanks for having me with you
