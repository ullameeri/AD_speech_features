I thought about Winnipeg I thought about the context and I thought about the location you know the forks is obviously the place to to build this building because it was a place of consensus among First Nations leaders and my inspiration comes from a document that I got kind of out of nowhere we we became aware of a an International competition up here and an open one which means you're just you just throw your cards out and often most often I through my career I've been invited to enter competitions you know you could pay to Skype in you get invited in there a few people this was wide open to the kind of international yellow pages and but it struck me about the uh what struck me was there was a master vision that was uh so profound and so challenging and inspiring that there was a it was a no no-brainer to do it just yeah we're gonna do it and then I thought about what how a building could represent that so I thought about routes connecting the earth how cultures that are oppressed or often so connected to the earth darkness to light those images kind of flooded in as I was working on a clay model a small clay model of the building and a sequential mountain of galleries clad in stone wrapped by a cloud the cloud containing the administrative section which is really part of the exhibits of the building because you'll see visitors will see people over here working on trying to keep what they just saw from happening again sort of national global centre national slash global center that the building will will uh certainly be I hope it's a transformational experience but also the uh the sense that hey there's have been in a very unusual space and there's something that that has changed me about that too but to have a building that's so fundamentally charged with um a deep responsibility for all mankind you know for as long as it lasts how how could anything overshadow that I can't think of anything
