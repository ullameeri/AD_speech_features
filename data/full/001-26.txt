Yea no I think it’s not just you know I mean I’ve never heard of you know Guns & Roses basically I’ve never heard them play but it’s that bands like that can play at some you know but I think they generally what’s happened is more like you know kids it’s more like you know big brothers passing down their records and things and it’s just it’s still appealing I think the music’s gotta be a long stay in music you know it’s not it’s not like the pop record that play for two weeks and is gone you know it’s something that goes on for years and coz our set I mean we’ve been playing twelve thirteen years and we’re still playing songs from the begin from the first album you know so it’s thing is you know a lot of in a combination you know over all of the years and and it’s happened to other groups you know before us you know we’re not the first but it’s nice to to to appeal to a couple of generations you know coz we’re getting too many wrinkles ourselves you know

Yea it is emn but I say it is anyway blues and rock’n’roll is the whole roots of it you know and emn you know the excitement that rock’n’roll used to generate you know jumping on his piano and you know the whole audience just going wild and singing along with them that’s what basically what we’re trying to do but you know more rock of course you know but that get the audience to participate in the whole thing you know go home think yea we want them to go home with the laryngitis you know that’s the idea 

That’s good that show’s you know you know we’ve still got a big lot that like us you know

No we we more like prefer atmosphere is the word if you can capture the atmosphere you know that’s more important than the sound you can always fix up the sound later on to a certain degree but we’re more into the feel of it you know rather than you know than than the sounds coming out unless there’s a horrible sound coming out but if you can catch the atmosphere that’s more important 

No no no that’s too much that’s like being in prison you know it’s nah it’s nothing like playing on stage that’s the most exciting 

No it’s it can be as fresh as the day you started some nights but some nights it’s a little hard you know if you you know might’ve been a bit jetlagged or something you know or you’re not feeling too well somebody’s got the flu could be a little difficult but if it’s a good night I mean it’s just like first night it’s the same buzz same excitement 
 
Yeah there’s I think there’s a lot of a lot of stuff’s doing it it’s still untacked as well you know I think there’s a lot more that we can do you know 

Cute pop music yea rock pop music yeah this is great we’ll go perfect you know you know that’s you know I think that the cover though has been going on is been going on for longer than I was got about than five years longer so emn I suppose this time he’s had success and he’s had to be become a pop sort of you know pop singer to good they used to be very heavy you know yeah I mean if he’s been doing for twenty years and got he would’ve made it a lot quicker I suppose it’s just taken him twenty years to realise he’s a pop singer it’s emn there’s bands like that all the time you know as we started there’s always the glamour bands and there was sort of the denim clan groups and emn you usually find the denim clan groups surviving and the glam ones fade away they get more endorse than glam ones could be that

But in general we thought the idea was to get the kids out of the TV you know out of their homes down to the show you know don’t watch TV come down see the real thing you know that’s what our idea was you know but at the same time again a lot of kids say they think it was terrible is what I’m saying though video same ideas it’s very difficult I mean the world’s around them is drying it’s pretty tough 

What we used to do sometimes fifteen sixteen shows in a week when we started we were never fresh then there believe me we had a lot of BO going around but emn yeah I still can basically you know obviously the backgrounds have changed you know the stages have got bigger there’s bigger kids there we stay in nice hotels you know we fly and don’t do day of travelling but emn we still remember you know you get on stage you know and there’s only twenty kids out you still give them same if there’s twenty thousand you know we try we always try our hardest no matter how you feel you know you always once you’re on the stage you’re gonna give your best and everybody in the band has always done it if somebody comes up and they feel they’ve let themselves down with the band I mean they’ve got bigger things to worry than themselves so I mean there’s this sort of thing everybody tries all the time and that’s what keeps it going we’ve been like this since the beginning
