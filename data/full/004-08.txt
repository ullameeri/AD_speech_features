well I’m very happy to be here I'm overwhelmed I didn't expect anything I mean of course I don’t know what you saw oh that was a bit I did first what was that I’ve forgotten oh I hope you saw something else well you saw Fred Astaire beautiful I’m in awe you know something it's Libra eh eh eh I had to tell you this but that's what it is it's like now this month um most of them except the road to Celina and uh the one with Rex Harris in it that wa- um was made in Spain um there was a Picture with it there was a picture with them with um Bob Mitchum Jack Lemmon Coldplay yeah fire down below that was made abroad and in the um in in the oh uh what’s the other thing I just finished making with um with um Mitchum and um some very good you know  fine actors I I sort of uh Jay Glandular was one of the one of many I mean you know but that was the last one the Mexico all of it was made in Mexico in one in one  yes the next one will be in London well uh there's one um movie I turn down um before I did covergirl and I said in place of doing that movie I'd rather do covergirl and you know who was the star of that picture that I turned down are you ready Cary Grant and I turned it down for covergirl I you know that’s something but then I did work with Carrie before Carrie good in a picture called Only Angels Have Wingsuh  which Howard Hawks he was really responsible for finding me in that as you know I think it was my first what they say made you at that time made your movie you know and he chose me to do that because I was under contract to Columbia and he was doing the picture there so I was very pleased to work with him I don’t know if you saw any of it it was marvellous I was terrified I mean I didn't have that much experience working with superstars such as uh Carrie Grant was in it and Jane Author I call superstars because they were you know and are I mean they will always be in that sense you see uh I think it was i- i- it was a I think I was yes I was treated as a person as an actress he he loaned me out you see I had a seven-year contract with um Columbia studios and um during the first few years he was a very bright man about handling um you know so I went to the first Picture I made outside of Columbia and I was under contract em to Harry Cohn I I've made a picture called Blood The Sand with Ty Power  that was before I was known at all you know I you know it was a sort of the initial sort of thing in a major Picture like it was like um for instance with mr. Harry Hoff it and and so he loaned me out to audition to studios I did strawberry blonde and alone out but I didn't I didn't um I got my salary at on the seven-year contract I got the salary that I got but when he loaned me out he would make a deal with these different people he was very very very smart about it pretty true when I think of that but he did help in in that way it was a marvellous way to he built me as a star in the studio through different studios you know and let them do all the you know um the day when I did it's kind of an interesting point of view then they invested you know and the first one who came along who wanted to a film and lead was mr. Fred Astaire and I did two two films with him and of course he knew my father because he work with my father and brought a little you know he registered his sister they worked together my father worked with his sister in New York and my father's a classic Italian classic um ballet and so was his sister they were trained for that and I was trained in the same way you know so that when Fred heard um Margarita Back Kotter and Lord Escarsino was under contract to to um Colombia he said oh she's got to be fantastic because he knew my father they you know through many many many many years of dancing and he knew what training I would I must have had well at um different films with Fred I did two uh films with Fred and he worked always did his own choreo program and and but but uh uh with the I worked with Hermes Pan and Pol Joey I worked with him and my gal Saud I worked with different you know but uh now that wasn't difficult I just have acrophobia and I thought I would never get down that ramp they put me on a tiny postage step you know a thing like that at the top is calm down when I’m falling down I know I love Jean Kelly I love Jean and and and I  enjoy working with him so much I mean that was just but you know when it shows hard work too uh no I didn't not in all of them I didn't in Gilda I did uh and I didn't zip in Pal Joey and I did see they at that time when when I did Gilda they had the big dance so they had big band singing you know it was a whole different sort of thing well you know I didn't sing with a big band but I sang with a guitar and I played it  the scene it was in the bar in Gilda you know there was one scene when when I didn't sing quietly that was me oh well that was that's obvious you know I couldn't sing flamenco that well that's very difficult that was truly you know uh well I really learned on the corner right you know I just I did that but I I couldn’t um flamenco guess if remindful started you have to be born there lived there although my father was they came from the south of Spain I didn't learn it because I was raised in the United States and that's something that you’re born with oh I I I think only um um because sh- sh- miss Sheridan had um we used to do she had she had some kind of difference or something or something like that with Warner Brothers and um she used to do strawberry blonde and um they were looking for someone so they asked um Harry Cohen what he’d think on oh he loaned me out again and and I did strawberry blonde because she didn't wish to do it for some whatever reason her what her reason was I don't know and and it was uh uh yeah it was very good film is that it was ahead of its you know time and everything and it was a departure for me and I want you know I wanted to do it and I I did it and I I think it’s just fantastic cause he's an innovator you know it's interesting to work with anybody who has that much imagination no it was done by all trick um shots but it was a fabulous um um scene I think it was really fantastic I had it bleached and it hurt because my hair is black let’s see what’s the most embar- quite a lot let me see it’s a long story no dancing with Ted Astaire once um in a film um I think it was um you were never lovelier um and we have a and we were rehearsing and um we were dancing like mad you know twirling around  everything and I went zoom spread-eagle knocked out on our couch no I slipped on this floor w- w- you know  we were rehearsing for for the take in the picture I fell right up funny so the next thing I knew I was sitting up on they put me up set me up on a chair and I just did her head said you you know you just slipped on the floor it was he was curious because they hadn't finished it properly that was kind of embarrassing you know here I am dancing with the great Fred Astaire at him right on my face ready to laugh  you know but uh let's see what else I don't know what’s more embarrassing it's not like a theater because at the theater you could some things can be very embarrassing in the screen they can stop that you know so you don't really um  break all your teeth oh because I've been more involved with um films I've thought about it many times and I yeah but I don't uh oh I’ld love to do something like that no it wasn't too hard it's just a matter that um uh it didn't work out in in in the way that I you know wanted it to and I'm a perfectionist and I will not um do a um stage play or or or musical without having plenty of time to rehearse and I didn't have enough time for me I didn't have enough have enough time you should have seen mrs. dare he had two months to rehearse or three now hey you know I said I can't do it in three weeks or two weeks because I'm a perfectionist when it comes to dancing and I want to be able to do it for the public my very topp point you know oh yeah I didn't think of it most times at that time if I'd know it was a cabin it didn't have any water or gas I mean it did you know a fireplace beautiful spot I can see it all now I wish I kept it I couldn't afford to keep it I couldn't pay for the taxes at this time well you know what I don't look up wake up in the morning and look at it at all I wake up on the afternoon um well I like to live around the world I mean if I could I'd like to have a house a little niche niche you know in every country that's the way I feel but I can't so right now I live in Beverly Hills huh tough isn't it eh no that's it I did you know we did yeah you know the real stuff yeah oh I know neither one were um difficult to dance with they they are both uh fabulous tech- technicians and dancers and uh there were not difficult to dance and it was a great pleasure a lot of work a lot of hard work we worked for hours and hours the same with oh that's a difficult one you know everybody has a style so in each style there are very difficult things to do I mean it's it’s like um you can't um put it in those terms that term or those terms really the amount of time that the big the due to the be able to be prepared to do it the way I would want to do it you know the reparation wasn't long enough I wanted a little bit more time no I don't have a favorite the the the people I've worked with the leading men they've all been great they um people to work with I can’t um you know they're professionals that's what they are and when they're professionals you know when people have professions they work together and that's that I mean you know there's no favorite thought she was great she did some great movies Ginger Rogers did some great movies what do you mean oh yes but she yeah she she was a we was in summer stock outside of Washington DC and she didn't follow through but she was in the Ziegfeld Follies that's where she met my father but they did oh but they did have a resemblance is something very very um very very um much like her face um kind of fits it does resemble very much so yes I thought it was fine I mean I’m not gonna it was lovely I mean it was difficult I was starting out and in in in the in the fi- in the movies and it was the beginning of something and then I gradually got into other things know that I acting like separate tables and things like that and I danced you see I was a dancer I was trained as a ballet dancer from the time I was four years old I went to Carnegie Hall so don't forget that well I was a great great man of his of course and he was a brilliant writer and wonderful person it was his first directorial job and um oh I enjoyed working with him I I liked working very much and I admired him as a writer he was an innovator Jill that's a privilege to be able to work with him uh well I'm going to London on November the 2nd that's about what I can tell you right now no it's it’s a film I'm going to do it in London Ralph Richardson saw Ralph Richardson and um um it it's a an episodic sort of thing and like a four a story piece yeah like Tales from Manhattan i’s a forth you know uh the director uh I think that the man was going to do it i- i- i- isn't that it's I'll know two days from now because something happened and and and it's been changed well if it hadn’t got a name yet  let's have an interesting yes something’s going on you know I never really asked him I just did the movie I wanted to be the directed by Orson Wells yeah I don’t know where they where they begin and end you know but that those images can be difficult I didn’t get that I mean personally I had um two films to do with Columbia I’d finished one with Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon and then I decided that they wanted me I had three pictures left on the contract with Columbia that's like I was there 18 years I had three Pictures left so I did um the one that came fire down below fire down below and then I came and I said I'll do two more pictures Pal Joey which they had so he did Pal Joey and I did another one uh what was the name of it I’ve forgotten that one not what I've had a fair answer to that oh that was something anyway so I did that and then I was finished with the contract altogether then well I'm working on I'm working all the time and thinking of things to do but I study uh uh singing boys I had a lot of things I I do I have many interests another you know other things that I you know would have liked but I'm not working I'd go and rehearse for applause for about two months beautiful sweet lovely man good accent oh yeah Jane Kelly Glenn Ford I see if I can think of anyone else oh and Fred Fred Astaire oh uh I should say about a day and a half
