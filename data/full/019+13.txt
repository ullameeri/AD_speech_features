that's great that's great well let me just uh tell you that I was uh moved by uh uh your article and I was so pleased uh  that you wrote the article for a lot of reasons oftentimes uh particularly happens with entertainers they put you in a box and somehow they don't see you as a person who has a life that includes family that includes interactions uh decisions that you have to make that has nothing to do with your performance and so they don't see you as thinking about uh the plight for example of black women or civil rights or any of these issues so that's why I was very pleased uh that you wrote it and so when we saw it we thought wow this is great and I'm so pleased let's let's write her let's let's let her uh that we think that that she's doing a great thing and has done a great thing uh and I want you to know that when you you know speak of yourself and you say maybe you know people think you're being too controversial etc etc pay that no attention for some people uh who don't have courage and don't have confidence they don't understand it when they see it in other people so uh you should be proud of that you should be proud of whom you are and I know you are and not only your talent but your person who what do you care about and and and what is it that you're you're doing that is not only good for you but it's good for others so thank you very much and I'm pleased to be with you well you know I think that because black women uh have not uh uh been respected in ways that will help them to feel good about themselves and they looked uh to others and particularly men uh in order to get approval uh then you know we need to say to black women first of all concentrate on whom you are and what you think and what you care about and approval does not always have to come from others other people's opinions do not make you uh and the opinion of men do not determine who you are and so we want women to have the kind of confidence that we're talking about today that you have Megan and uh so I think it is anything that we can say uh to other black women is that get grounded get grounded you have an opinion uh and you you're thinking and you uh you you you're taking charge of your life rather than have everybody else telling you what you can do what you should do what you shouldn't do uh and so building confidence is the most important lesson that we can share first of all we have to take people where they are and uh we have to be honest uh with people about whom we are and we have to be honest in ways that will help people to open up and be honest with you and so if we put ourselves high on a pedestal somewhere and we're talking about I'm your role model and you got to do this and you got to act this way and you got to dress this way and you should be doing this etc first of all we're not being honest uh and secondly uh we have people who address issues in different ways we have people certainly who have you know different thoughts things that we don't even think about or know about and we have people who um you know don't accept you know what is considered the tradition and we have to respect that and we have to take people where they are and when we approach people it is not trying to uh have them believe that somehow uh you're more pure you're more uh knowledgeable you're more anything accept people where they are and they'll accept you where you are so when I see someone and uh I'm talking with them I'm looking at them and I'm listening to them I don't care what they have on I don't care about anything else but what this person is expressing and I'm not judging them on anything else except what they're sharing with me and uh for me that is a way that you connect with others that is the way you build community that is where you get trust and that is where you come to other people's aid when people need you you come to their aid I'm talking about just having the ability to have someone listen to you uh that's he- that's hearing what you're saying or you're sharing a moment and so that's how you build community uh you respect people uh you take them where they are and you come to the aid when they need you wow that is so commendable uh to you know talk about how you can help other women and let me just tell you uh when I think about you and you continuing your education I said to myself you know what she doesn't have to go to nobody's school anymore she's got it she's done it she's got it made so that is so absolutely uh commendable that uh you continue to focus on education when you know you don't have to I mean you know people go to school to try to get to where you are and here you are in this place and you're still you know paying attention that's right and I remember if you had you know grandmama great grandmama and mama and all of that I know what they said girl get educated because they can't take it out of your head they can't take it away from you if you get it that's what they always said right get educated well that's great and and again I I commend you for continuing uh to do that and now I understand even more why it's important to you you're not just doing it for yourself you're doing it for them and I'm sorry to hear about the losses that you've had one of the most important things for each of us to do is to examine who we are and to get grounded in who we are and have our own philosophies about life and what we care about that's very important to know yourself know yourself know who you are and when you do that and you set out to do things like Stacey Abrams and other women who have been involved in voter registration it's because you want to do it it is because this is who you are this is because you believe uh that you have the power and the ability uh to be helpful and to change things now how do you do that and then not have others expected uh of you uh expecting of you to do other things and more and more and more once you get grounded in whom you are then you know how much you want to do you know how how much you don't want to do you are not driven about what others always want you to do you're driven by what you feel and what you think and what is right because you know who you are you're grounded in such a way that your uh direction is determined by you so if Stacy wanted to you know go out and register people 24 hours a day and go to all of those counties that she went to you know that had never seen an elected official that's because she's made some decisions about herself and so when somebody else comes along and they say now you've done all of that now here's what we want you to do she knows how to say yeah nay that's not who I am this is what i'm doing and stay on your own track and do what drives you and what makes you feel good and what feels right for you I have no problem saying no because I've learned that if you don't say no you'll be overwhelmed uh with what everybody else wants you to do what they think you should do and people call on me sometimes uh to talk about uh subjects I have no idea what they're talking about and I have to say you're talking to the wrong person I don't know anything about that and so you have to know uh when to say no I know what you mean when uh when you talk about uh the compliments that you get uh for what you do and then people start telling you about other things you should be doing it could be doing these problems that they ran into that they need some help on except you can't do everything and you're not good at everything and so do what your heart your mind your soul tells you and and and what you know about what you what makes you feel right and good and be grounded in all of that and sometimes you have to say no I'm sorry I can't do that so that's how that's how I handle the world well uh first of all uh I have to tell you Megan I am kind of old school now you know because um I I still I I I still listen to some of the old uh um songs uh that some women in the blues and jazz community you know gave to us you know I'm talking about uh a Billie Holiday or Sarah Vaughan uh some of these women I have all of those recordings and uh I still listen to them but I want you to know something happened to me at the height of uh gangsta rap and this is what happened we had so many people who didn't understand this new genre and we had so many uh you know mature people who wanted to censor uh you know particularly gangster rap and so I can recall when there was a woman who was actually the secretary of state I think in uh Pennsylvania who took up the issue of censoring rap artists and uh I'm a real first amendment person who believes in the right of freedom of speech and uh and so I took up the calls uh with Tupac and with Dr J and with a number of artists to defend them and so I went before the united states senate and uh at that time I recorded something that Tupac had done uh where he talked about his mom it was so um inspiring uh when he talked about you know he basically said you know she's a dope baby but she's my queen you know and I thought these these people got something to say you know and they're saying something that's very important and so what I do is I listen to the young people around me and they may tell me something maybe you ought to you know pay attention to and I might listen to something like when they told me how to listen to uh huh no no no I know about savage because I did pay attention to that kind of on my own I paid attention to that because it was a remix and I like the idea of getting together with Beyonce and you know what I mean I thought that was that was really really important for a lot of reasons uh one was you know Beyonce had been around a bit longer and had seen achieved a certain level of success uh but she was not thinking of herself in such a way that she knew more uh that you know she had achieved so much she came looking for you and she did this remix and I thought that's what women do that's what black women do when they're busy with each other you know so I kind of paid attention to that but then they told me to look at that was it what and uh I did don't worry don't worry don't worry don't worry don't worry and here's what I said now that's audacity that is audacity and that is uh the ability for women to take charge of what they want to say because as I said I had paid attention to the young um you know gangster rap a time when you know men were in charge they say whatever they wanted to say they said whatever they want to say about women uh what have you but women uh you know didn't say for a long time uh what they could say or wanted to say or dare to say and so I thought that's audacity so I'm with you I'm fine I have no problem uh with that the genre as it evolves from the time that you know I've seen all kinds of uh transitions take place you know with some of the younger uh artists uh until I'm saying today uh that you young women have taken control of your art and you're you're you're defining it in ways that never would be defined by anybody else and you're willing to have the courage and the nerves and the audacity to say whatever the hell you think when hardcore rap was not accepted even by black people and the ministers in the church and you know like this uh woman who was an elected official who drew some other people in you know and I won't name the names but they drew in some very famous uh singers who joined with them the pure creativity and the talent of rap took over and you know and it took over not because uh the white media or anybody else helped with that it took over because it was so accepted by so many and so loved by so many and that's how it keeps evolving it keeps involving in ways that now you have a Megan who is up for four grammy awards but doing it her way reclaiming my time well I just say that because that that turned out to be so much fun and I got adopted by the millennials based on confronting uh the uh treasury secretary who was trying to talk over me and talk around me uh but unfortunately or fortunately I come from a huge family I had 12 brothers and sisters and I you know a father who left early a stepfather a mother who struggled and so my mother was very outspoken and she was a very strong woman and she always you know taught us to you know don't talk about what you don't have make do with what you have and all of those lessons uh that were you know very important uh uh to me um that I learned and so she was outspoken and I'm sure a lot of what I do you know emanated from her but the other thing is when you're in a house with 13 kids you better be outspoken if you want to get heard if you want to get recognized if you want to make sure that uh you know all the dinner's not gone when you come in uh from you know your uh practice at your high school or something you have to learn to speak up and so I've been controversial because of that because I dare to speak up and as you know I started asking for the uh impeachment of the president from the time he was inaugurated up until today on the second impeachment I saw him for what he was as a dangerous human being and so I received a lot of uh criticism for that but you know I love constructive criticism uh but outplace uh criticism doesn't bother me uh I am outspoken and uh that's who I am wow that's great that's so great and um my husband is from Houston he has a large family you know all around um Houston and um he came from fifth ward and went to Phyllis Wheatley and so you know he came from the hood he came from the neighbourhood and of course I know some of the I remember when rap uh really got uh prominent coming out of the South and coming out of Houston and I know Scarface and all those people and so um you know I appreciate that Houston produces so much talent you know so much talent has come out of Houston and so you're a role model whether you want to be or not and um you to be commended for sharing and forgiving and for helping others and um you know I'm looking forward to uh you know your being successful with the Grammys just to be nominated is extraordinarily important I mean that's big time and so you have reached um you know a certain level of success uh that um you should be very very proud of and um the world is yours and there's no end to it there's no stopping uh you have proven that you can get what you want and you can go where you need to be so thank you so much love talking with you enjoy today well thank you it's been joyful I've loved being with you today
