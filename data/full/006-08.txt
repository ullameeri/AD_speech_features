okay I’d say you're a jock you're really a great athlete and you just want to show off so you look handsome but this this is you no actually it's a it’s something that we have done at at UT Knoxville to raise funds for women's athletics and we're coming down to obviously Jackson to raise money for a scholarship and and for UT Martin and scholarship is invading Darren and Betty Giles honor and if went for those two ladies I wouldn't be the coach at Tennessee so well Betty jaws was the athletics director and she was pretty uh headstrong lady when I went to ask her when basketball trials were she said uh well you first have to play volleyball in order to play basketball and I believed her so I played four years of volleyball so she uh did a great job she's had a tremendous impact on women's athletics right there on that campus at UT Martin but also nationally and she's very very well respected nightingale was our coach and uh she's a super lady's been a great friend to me and and she uh had a pretty rowdy group to coach not me but my teammates were a little out of control at times you believe that and uh she just she went along with uh us and helped us and got us to uh the one of the first AIAW that's what it was instead of NCAA Association of intercollegiate athletics for women and Nadine would drive the van and we would uh we would tell stories and I'm gonna tell a few night on Nadine well it’s huge and and as you might know right there the Mystics you see uh Stacy uh Dale Schumann it's a great player and we drafted last year but it's very important it's a great motivation for young girls to want to be a part of this and to keep this game going at a different level well we do recruiting never ends I'll tell you that much and we have two players coming in I'm really excited about and Sydney Spencer's from Alabama Player of the Year Dominica Reading from Clearwater Florida and also when the top players in that state so hopefully those two can help well you gotta look at Shower Eli Loi More and Brittany Jackson and I said when they were freshmen they have a national championship in them somewhere but I thought that was gonna be in Atlanta so now they got to come back seat and get one in New Orleans well there's a lot of talent there's no question and and I think the key for us is the offseason and how much they're willing to work on their game to get better but I'm excited a lot of people a lot of people have us ranked between five and nine in the country that's a great motivation for our Lady Vols we gonna do our best they're in Knoxville we're gonna sell out that place and uh I would say the fans probably won't be too kind the team's got to be ready to play Oh Greg well i'm thinking the deal might get cut tonight what do you think they're asking they're asking
