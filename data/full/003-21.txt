Well in a way it kind of it to my system it’s a bit of a shock you know and an honourable shock as a matter of fact but I’m not quite used to this and um I you know avoid things that are similar to this but this is an honourable thing for me so of course I participate in it and um like it’s hard to believe you know that I’m getting a star on a sidewalk in Hollywood and all that kinda thing so um might take it all with all good humour a little bit of nervousnessSomebody said to me I think it was the Warren Callon officer they wanna put a star on the sidewalk with your name in it and how do you feel about it I said well why did they doing that they said well you know you’re for the Hollywood you’re a star and and they um do it once a month for an actor or a somebody who has represented Hollywood in one way or another in the entertainment field
