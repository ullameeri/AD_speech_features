yes well um my father Thomas Cotton was not what you'd call standard parson or preacher um his father was an eminent lawyer and determine intended him because he was the bright one to become the same my father Tom was brought up with a little religion at all but in his teams somehow he got it I should have asked him for more but I never had he did got it um and he um nerved himself and said to this rather alarming father I'm sorry father I don't want to be a lawyer I want to be a parson oh said his father all right and very seldom smoked him again so he was on his own but I mean this something was coming up and in he became parson and in 1916 he arranged to be a chaplain and was sent to the front where he found himself having to explain to dying men why they were dying what they were dying for this was the formative experience of his life it absolutely appalled him and he became a serious a sort of all-purpose pacifist who did all kinds of peace work from there on became very friendly with Fiona Briton who was doing the same thing um and that sort of was the centre of his life so that's the life which I and my brother grew up with um and it's certain it wasn't being a preacher's kid in the sense of being in a little group which was separate from everybody else he he he worked as a as a parson parson too um but it was the background um you know his general view seemed to me to be very good I thought it's basically a jolly good he was kind sensible kind of socialist an internationalist and all those things but I kind of never picked up on what obviously should be senseful in such a situation a direct relation god I know I was told he was there and I ought to be sort of saying something to him but he was not a figure in my life and I couldn't make it so so um I went on yes I'm sort of going to church quite happily and um living with this as a part of the background of life but I never did pick up and I still have not picked up um a clear vision of the universe in which one says yes that's god up there um you know um  and as time has gone on I'm not sure that as it were this is necessary um because people apprehend these things in different ways and I certainly have no sort of sense that Christianity is based on mistake I mean the the the ethics of it appear to be quite right and the um idea that you should love everybody else to treat them as such is very you know basic to me still um and it doesn't it still doesn't take the form which is I suppose supposed to take so that's my situation well it's quite interested the number of have commented on this fact that there were a number of who went to Oxford and did very good since then they don't seem to be coming up the same sort of way well if you are present at a typical philosophical discussion uh along with a number of dedicated American graduate students you can see how nobody gets a word in edgeways and if by chance they do get a word in edgeways nobody takes any notice of it I I don't think one can actually extend to which they are not heard uh it's partly a matter of simply the liaising your voice you may think you could lilies your voice easily but if you had a few of these people here again I don't know how much it matters um but I do think it's unfortunate and it's only part of a change in academic life altogether away from the personal away from the direct expression that means towards uh uh getting all the details right and um being able to prove things and so forth which I think is altogether very unfortunate um but I have done all I can as it were I don't think I can go probably going back and judging people I can't even prick that's I think so um I mean I should also say that I wasn't working in a sort of way that would have been acquired to get a doctorate I wasn't I was it didn't enable  me to dig in to Protanus or what I was interested in in the right sort of way because obviously I was working for something which hadn't been done yet you see and contradicted something with somebody had already said uh my um supervisor uh meant well I'm sure but wasn't able to get me through that one um so I have continued to be extremely interested in philosophy and I wish I'd written on Orphostangus now that I think about it I think he's really good um but uh like a lot of people have been taken up a topic which interestingly I went off and did it in other ways uh rather than completing it and what keeps happening to people now when they do doctorate they get as it were an option between doing more or less at whole of the subject that they're interested in and having their peaces referred because it's the something here that isn't completely waived you see um I'm chopping off uh a little bit uh it can get through quite easily about chopping off a little bit seven-day academic world increasingly is consisting of people who chopped off little bit and I think this is very hard watching it when they do we live in the marketing world this guy was over far too easily and I as it were natural selection the people who can do this come up at the top don't they well what it is is saying uh uh science is top isn't it you know it it it it it is a status claim seems to me because what they're what they're saying is normal with the our own consciousness and the thoughts that we have all the time they are not part of um of any sort of science scientific conclusion that you can state there that they are part of the real world and um they uh there is you see a purpose kind of philosophy at the basis of this a metaphysic which a materialist in a sense that it says there is nothing except matter you um you know which is chemicals not not as it were solid things like tables but chemicals um that's all there is really because that's what we talk about and what we talk about must be what matters so to speak uh I think it's very potty and you see what Crick does is he throws this off at the beginning of his book go very quickly into a lot of more detailed stuff come back a little later say the scientific account of of of human beings is that that uh all our thinking  can be explained by explained by the movements of our brain cells you don't explain thinking in that sort of way I mean you can look at a bit of thinking like what Einstein's theories you see uh and ask somebody to explain it and they say well you see there's the the the the this and that went to the left and went to the right and so forth it's absolutely not relevant at all and why don't they say it's not relevant they don't see it because they are fixated on this um set of set of of of patterns which constitute the science uh which is indeed you know all right and quite useful they're fixated on that as if it were the only real thing um and I really think it's quite important what has lately been pointed out that the more obsessive you get the more than left-hand side of your brain is active the left-hand side does all in detail with thinking the left-hand side doesn't know when something else is needed as well the right-hand side puts it in context looks for a whole in which it's only a part uh and looks for uh the background of the world which uh has to be now even when these physical things or brain cells aren't moving um and if you don't encourage your right brain to do this you can get completely stuck with the left brain because if I had it isn't outward looking you see it doesn't know that it doesn't know anything I'm not sure if I'm ought to be launching on this because it's not everybody's cup of tea but I think it's a very important fact and that's science right well what happened was this when I wrote beast and man I took a lot of trouble to read EO Wilson's Sociobiology which is uh a rather reductive way of thinking but quite some of it mind quite a respectable one I I I I knew where that was and I hadn't even read the Selfish Gene I thought I will that would be another example of the same stuff um when I did read it I was profoundly shocked and what profoundly shocked me was the the drama that was being put in you see all this about Chicago gangsters and and and uh dramas as it were whole novels about gene and what it would do uh  treating it as an agent as as just as a creature that was taking charge um and you see what I now think is this caught on so well because this was the age of Thatcher and Reagan selfishness was the latest thing it was thought to be very good for uh the the country and the civilization and everybody else um and all these myths these little stories in the book Selfish Gene were on that side and were saying yes of course all motivation is uh self-interest um and um you would be very silly if you were to try to follow anything else so I was appalled and in a state of fury I wrote a rather cross article uh which prepared in philosophy to this effect and uh a little bit of controversy followed but Dawkins picked up the idea that I hadn't read the Selfish Gene he picked this up from a Swedish biologist to whom I had told the story as I have just told it to you um but he picked it up wrong um and he went about for a time saying that I never read the selfish gene about which I have written so much now the articles that I wrote about it contain six or seven long quotations from the book um you see and well are quite detailed about the about the book eventually I wrote to Dawkins and said this won't do it didn't happen did it and he checked with the Swedish biologist and said no it didn't but since that time I have to say he's got on saying it again and but what this shows is he is deeply identified with this Creed this Creed of uh really self-interest which is the the myth the the vision that inspired the Selfish Gene it isn't the science that is conservative Selfish Gene of course has some perfectly good science in it uh but it's but it's the um the dream the the the the motivation which which he uh uh was illustrating and you see as time's gone on um Thatcherism has become a little less popular to the rest of us because and a lot of things turned out not to work no of course they are not and why would they be this is there should be no surprise but it does need saying and when one comes across a lot of boasting about how science is the only source of truth um people are ignoring that which is really pretty obvious and when one knows any individual scientists one knows they have their own motives and why wouldn't they have um so I mean I um uh when I oppose scientistm which I frequently do I really am not opposing sciene I hope you get that quite clear silence itself does not call for no no science calls for uh this is exclusively claim you see it's telling you how and what can not there are a lot of different sciences which yes I mean this is just they are officially simply talking about physical matter and what particles do don't convey a message but if they're talking people biologists who are talking about living creatures do convey a message and the language in which they put it is often very misleading because it is designed to show um that this well the the brain cells are the only thing that's happening I mean people who particularly people who think that only uh humans have minds and animals are unconcious which is a doctrine that really got into science I'm afraid for they casted it 16 hundreds in the states since people who think that are um talking about um what animals do as if it nothing were happening except that they are now this is obviously absurd I mean we can see now we agree that we have developed animals which were uh rather similar to other animals in the process of doing that we acquired these capacities to do things which humans do and which aren't lot of things which not only humans like being nice to our children and so forth um being acquired these capacities and tendencies um and they are just as real as what inside our heads and it is not the truth the truth that as it were the little small things are written um but the whole perks is that so to speak and this I really must come back to this point I feel that this one really needs to think of the whole being as uh in charge is very typ- typical of this kind of trouble can I get back to Lovelock cause I still well the idea of gaia is that you are the earth as a whole organism a whole which acts as a whole with the earth and the living things on it um not just a  scene in which a lot of little particles are doing this or that um but an active uh agent developing agent Lovelock put this forth in the early 70s I think or a bit before and at once when I saw it I thought god that's right you know yes um it makes sense of the the whole of life the evolution of everything and the the the of all the living things and of the earth that it grows out of um but most scientists objected to and then rejected it and one thing that made them reject it I think is the name um Lovelock was looking for a name and didn't find one and he's been the novelist oh what's the fellows name oh sorry suggested gaia which is the the Greek goddess of the earth and at once Lovelock's oh that's pretty good yes and he took it up but the myth that this suggests the world in which a uh uh in which something like a planet can act as a whole is absolutely contrary to the myth that scientists own habits of accepting uh because they're in the habit of accepting atomism that is the idea that only the smallest uh particles actually do anything this is a very odd idea if you think about it because when you think about the incredibly elaborate world which has been built up the idea that these uh little protons and so forth uh could have all the idea of that's in their heads you know and could know how to do it isn't at all sensible but what is but it is it is a it's a Creed which scientists accept without noticing what a big supposition it is and why they should make it um so he had a lot of trouble for quite a long time people sometimes accepted some of it and said oh but it's exaggerated isn't it um and they tended to treat it as a bit of a joke um the conference hung Gaia which was held oh what is it in late in 50s um I was there um included a lot of detailed stuff about what happens to the atmosphere and sea and so forth and um but it all included a talk on the philosophy of this by me and a talk of the politics of it by a political scientist and well the first evening at supper we were talking about this programme and I said well I rather wished that these could have been at the beginning but they had both at the end and the chap officer said
