well I think by and large it's his uh general good humour and positive take on what goes on in this curious town when he started in 55 uh I'd been out here a couple of years and but and the studio system by then was ending I was part of the the independent bunch that came in later but uh the studios were still there they still had contract lists in 55 and uh Heather Hopper was still writing so was Wella Parsons I think Mike Connolly was still on a reporter in Jimmy Starr the whole bunch and uh Army brought a fresh kind of optimism and good humour uh to covering the movie beat and he's continued to do that for 50 years and he deserves all our uh good wishes uh as a friendly diarist oh my goodness I've I’ve not only in his column but of course his uh uh omnipresent uh appearances at the academy which he uh covers the endless hours that takes and he's always there and uh always uh speaking well of people uh in the age of tabloid journalism uh a TV interview or a radio interview or a a press interview uh for the inexperienced can be a minefield and you don't need to worry about that with Army and I think that's fair yeah well you just said we just did that he's a he's a a friendly diarist well that's very good it it Army has said many kind and warm things about me for which I am properly grateful but uh of course that is true uh the occasional appearance on Saturday Night Live or Letterman or The Tonight Show uh kind of relieved the rather formidable authoritarian image that all those prophets and princes and uh policemen and quarterbacks uh have imposed on the public's impression of me an Army has always uh always been a good friend I'm delighted to see his 50th anniversary celebrating well I think you can count on Army to run the item correctly quoted which is hard to do and many journalists don't bother to do it or intentionally distort the quote Army al- always gives the accurate quote uh and is not not going to put a negative spin on it sure enough
