well Johnny I think that one of the things is that people keep looking to government for the answer in government's the problem um you moment ago you asked you know about people and feeling not only confused but right low and down in America first of all the American people if they would just take a little inventory and look around you triple our troubles and we're better off than any other people on earth and we've asked so much of government and we've gotten in the habit over the last 40 years of thinking that government has the answers there's very little that government can do as efficiently and as economically as the people can do themselves and if government would shut the doors and sneak away for about three weeks we'd never miss them now the if if the people no I said this while I was in government our biggest problem is that we have built a permanent structure of government federal state and local the permanent employees and they've come to the place that they actually determine policy in this country more than does the Congress of the United States there are 14 and a half million public employees in the United States that's quite a voting bloc and the bureaus and agencies not in in Washington I heard you talking earlier about uh some of the research programs well there was a senator the other day and he took up some pages of the congressional record he was doing the same thing you were listing all these crazy research programs and how much they were costing and wound up his speech by introducing his own he wants a study in a research of Transcendental Meditation you know there's a state senator in Michigan and he just found out the other day they got a ninety-three-thousand-dollar-study on whether chitlins are bad for you and and he said that there's a fourth-generation chitlins you know and he figured that he could tell you how for ninety three cents you can find out the answer to that oh listen there you had you had some beauties and there's some others what would you say if I told you about one a study in which this was called the the demography of happiness and in this study the government found out that young people are happier than old people and uh they found out that people that earned more are happier than people that earn less and they found out that well people are happier than sick people now this was two hundred and forty-nine thousand dollars to find out it's better to be rich young and healthy than old poor and sick well 62% of the people can't stay home in an election and cure things as we did in the last election it’s the lowest percentage in history only 38% of the people voted in the national election and this means that people aren't paying any attention to what well here a poll was taken recently that found out that only 46% of the people in the poll could name their United States congressmen but what was worse 86% of those who could name him couldn't tell you a single thing that he represented or stood for he was a congressman but what's he doing while he's up there and the same is true at the at the local levels of government and and all the rest but um and let them know special interest groups now the special interest groups aren't as everyone thought big powerful business interests or something that are going to persuade government to do things as a matter of fact I don't know anyone with less influence today in government than business they're just a convenient whipping boy but it's the groups that have got a particular axe to grind you can't have a power plant because it might interfere with a the seagulls no I think I'm an environmentalist and I do not agree with those people way over in the edge who pave the whole country over in the name of progress but also I don't like those on the other extreme that won't let you build a house unless it looks like a bird's nest someplace in the middle we got to allow people our ecology too well this kind of group and they want their particular program hundreds of dollars have been added to the cost of an automobile putting gadgets on it to declare up the air we're the only country in the world that's set out to do it that way the automobile industry over and over again told government if they give them more time the answer lay in making the motor more efficient and making it burn the fuel better and um when they were given the limited time there was only one with a and they could turn to that was the atoms that you had to go uh you remember that answer I gave you about the CIA no I think it's an unanswerable question I don't think anyone in view of the things that go on in the last few years knows what's gonna happen in the in the next two years down the road I think that everyone should hope and pray that people to they'll do the job so well there won't be any question about it because if they do then everything's alright with the rest of us uh well I agree with some things and disagree with others when they when they give me a when they give me a choice between a fifty three billion dollar deficit in the budget and an eighty billion dollar deficit when budget deficits are what's causing inflation I don't see that there's any room to be on either side of that argument I think the answer to curing inflation is a balanced budget well balancing the budget is like protecting a virtue you have to learn to say no well no there's some ways that this could be brought about first of all that limitation here here's another one why shouldn't we have in addition to a simplified income tax why shouldn't we also have a law that says that any time a legislator or a congressman introduces a spending program he has to introduce with it a tax program to pay for it then let the people find out there was a woman that uh from a financial firm that was back at the president's Economic Council and her words weren't quoted everybody else's words got in the paper all the hellos and the Gaul breaths and all the so-called economist and I had a I have a degree in economics so I can say this I think an economist is someone who has a Phi Beta Kappa key on one end of his watch-chain and no watch on the other uh this woman said that he you go to the polls and you ask the people do they want some social service some program that government can give and the people in the polls are apt to read and say that sounds good yeah but she says that isn't exactly accurate she says put a $100 bill in each person's hand and then show them the program and say now isn't that a nice program do you want it give me the hundred dollars she says see what the poll says then how many people hang on with a hundred dollars instead of the program they all start all the government programs start $1 down and we'll catch you later and and they they multiply all of those things that you were the Office of Management and Budget in Washington that's responsible for the budget putting up putting the budget together cannot even tell you how many boards commissions agencies bureaus and departments there are in the federal government but all of them can pass regulations and those regulations have the force of law and the difference is when you break the law you're innocent until proven guilty when you break a regulation the fella that charges you with a break in the regulation you're guilty and you want to take him to court and prove you're innocent that's up to you  and uh all of these are things that that yes we can trim the budget there's enough fat in the federal government that if you rendered it you could wash the world well we we are uh fed up we're war-weary after a long and badly fought war on the other hand and this is one where I'll probably lose a lot of people because it isn't popular or political to say this uh today when uh we withdrew our troops we made a ceasefire a peace agreement and it was based on uh sup- supporting the non-communist forces in Indochina on a basis of one for one replacement every bullet they expended a bullet to replace it if the Communists violated the ceasefire the Communists have violated the ceasefire 72 thousand times since it was instituted and we brought our men home and I think for the United States to break its word we're in that agreement we pledged something and the Congress is now saying that the United States reserves the right to just break its word and not what other allies ever go to trust us and I there's no question that backed by Red China and the Soviet Union the communist forces in Vietnam and Cambodia are on their way to take those over they do of course Laos just automatically falling then they're on the edge of Indonesia a hundred and forty million people which comes within 14 miles at its nearest point of the Philippines the domino theory is and yes it is and I I could see the United States one day being very very lonely now it's a very funny thing that the same forces that want to cut our defence spending are the same ones that want to increase all these social services in this social tinkering and experimenting that hasn't worked and every time it doesn't work they just impose a more expensive program on top of it I think the American people if they really look at all effects uh yes we want fiscal responsibility but I think we also want a country that is strong enough at all times that we can say to any adventurous guys over there on the other side of the water you better look twice brother before you start getting rough that we can take care of ourselves and I can understand that people aren't and it's hard to understand how maybe your interest is involved ten thousand miles away uh but Russia seems concerned that their interests extend all the way to Cuba and to South America to Chile into other countries of that kind and they're the ones that have said they're going to impose their way of life on the rest of the world we haven't said we want to do it to the rest of the world are we well I'd still prefer to see uh a revitalization of the two major parties we have uh because the two-party system has served us very well third parties have a notorious way of not being successful now the Republican Party some people say well that was a third party a hundred years ago when it started it actually wasn't it was a second party the Whig party had shrunk and shrunk and then the remainder of the Whig party said to two other groups that had formed parties hey want to get together with us they changed their name and called themselves the other party and so it was in effect the Whigs just disappeared it was just a new second run uh maybe this is time maybe it's time for realignment between people who might be find themselves in the wrong parties maybe there are some people still voting I was a Democrat most of my life I became a Republican only not too many years ago and uh I had the pleasure of telling some of those people that are saying the Republican Party ought to broaden its base the other day that uh when I switch parties I didn't do it because the two parties were alike I did it because they were different and um I think that the two parties are to stand up as to what they represent what they stand for a third party I they have a way of electing the wrong people they because they simply divide themselves from the other forces that feel the same way and then the other fella sneaks in and then I it it could happen that the that neither party would would represent what the people want and finally the people would take some action do something about it but I'd I’d rather devote our effort to see and if we can't find out what the present two parties stand for and which one we want yeah you sure sure don't I wish I could think of a good get off Nancy Nancy you know said to just say hello tonight she thought it was great that we're both in town at the same time
