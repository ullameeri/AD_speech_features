in a late fifties I was in a I was working in KLB Albuquerque New Mexico we’d a show called noon-day roundup it was Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys Faron Young came through came in to the show he obviously didn’t come in because it was the Faron Young show and they went to Armory in Albuquerque and em it was a Faron Young show featuring Elvis Presley em Faron had went on last the first night of the tour and they said from that day on he went out and did his show then he introduced Elvis and I could see why and it was very very dynamic Bob Elvis came out with the three pieces and just floored me you know just him and in the three pieces and base drums and guitar and it was awesome no they’re not doing the old Elvis Elvis was so dynamic then em em just his voice carried everything his e-e it was rhythm his phrasing but yeah I saw him in Vegas too and in fact it was March of 77 and it was right before he died in August of that year God rest his soul and em it wasn’t it wasn’t the same Elvis I saw in em naturally that I saw in fifty six or seven in Albuquerque and em the whole show was different you know it was big-time showbiz with a big band and giving his scarves away but in that it was very pure when I saw him in the late in the late fifties em it was it was awesome Elvis Presley I worked on em Viva Las Vegas soundtrack movie where I’m playing guitar and em he could walk in a studio and you could you could you knew he was in the room even if he if he em even if you didn’t know he came in the door he had that much em charisma that much magnetism it was it was awesome yeah well I don’t think he knew he had it but he was kinda em shy about it you know it’s em Elvis was a shy person a lot of people don’t know that and everything he’d do on stage was never choreographed back then it was all spontaneous I think later on it was more or less choreographed yeah that was a thrill I’ll tell you em I’d always loved Sinatra I mean I grew up with Sinatra because we had a battery radio when I was a kid and my dad did and whatever came on and in the forties I was a kid and that and that was Sinatra’s big year actually and I love Frank Sinatra but to sit there and play on the session we’we set and ran the song for about I guess an hour Stangers in the Night and em Sinatra came in and did about thr- did three takes on it I think and scooby-dooby-doo and thanked everybody and he was gone that was just fascinating see this capo that’s what got me so much studio work I’ll show you what I did on Strangers in the Night just for the heck of it now you can play in sharp and flat keys and em I was the last guitar and there was four acoustic guitars nobody knew how to how to use a capo in LA  but with this you know strangers in the night exchanging glances and you can't play it like that without a capo and em Ernie Freeman thought it was very unusual that I could play the ringing sounds and the minors and everything in sharp and flat keys you know it's funny I got a lot of studio work from Ernie doing that oh the work with the Righteous Brothers they were so great in fact and later on I I I went out as their opening act after Gentle on my Mind came out and it was very fun let’s go out with me and guitar and do 15 to 40 minutes and then they’d have a live in mostly colleges yeah so yes I would say so and uh when Hall & Oates came out with You've Lost That Lovin’ Feelin I played with him side to side and it was there was quite a bit of difference there em that was to me probably the best record I played on maybe with the exception of Bridge Over Troubled Waters em those two paying real high on my list it was a the album after Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer and Nat always liked to warm up before he would do the sessions he'd sit and play piano it was Ray Brown on bass Earl Palmer I think was drums and I’d said I know I said I’m gonna get up next to Nat’s pianist and I just play acoustic 12-string as as well as playing rhythm on the sessions with and it jammed you know it was great that it was a musicians’ commandery type of thing like football players have a comma- you know that em it was a so it was Nat I looked at him more as a piano player actually but boy you know people don't realize how what a great musician he was before he was as good a jazz pianists you know I mean I put him up there with Earl Gardner or Oscar Peterson or any of those guys it was it was great fun it was like going to Juilliard for eight years only learning you know from you know in the course of a week you'd play on Sinatra you’d do Merle Haggard you'd play with the Steve and Edie our Nat King Cole it was just it was just fabulous I loved that and that's really broadened my my whole attitude about music because when I left Albuquerque I lived in Albuquerque I got all the Django Reinhardt's old stuff and I was gonna be a jazz guitarist that was that I was gonna leave jazz man but I realized there weren’t a whole lot of jazz in Albuquerque and that's I went to the west coast to kind of seek that and I ended up with the champs of the Rose tequila for a buds right no I didn't play on it I played on Limbo Rock I’m glad I’d never played on another one of those right same thing Billie Strange wrote it I I never got so sick of playing something all my life world yeah that was Chubby Checker's record we had but that was there was a time period there was some great talent in the group especially with Jimmy Seals and Dash Crofts Dash was playing drums and Jimmy was playing the sax and fiddle in the Champs and they it was Seals an Crofts later and gods happy to see him do that right it's it's sad that music is is put in cubby holes you know this is this is country this is contemporary country this is a conservative country it's our pop or rock or whatever it’s really is sad and I don't know I'm not I'm not mad about it I'm happy to be here Bob I'll never forget the Supremes were on that show em  that's where I first met Diana Ross and oh what a great gal but I was going back to the to the new music you know I could play on every kind of different instrument I was utility singer on the show and guitar player I'll never forget I did Kansas City Star one week and the ne Roger Miller's thing and em they dressed me up in a 10-gallon hat and sheepskin clothes they made everything try to fit and the next week I did I'm Alive by the Animals and it was Sinatra bit you know it was really strange Roger Rogers Roger they gave him a right arm to be ambidextrous David Gates played bass on it too first time Brian got sick they called me on Thursday and said Glenn can you go to Dallas with us Saturday night I said and do what and they said play bass and sing Brian's part and that was Thursday the gig was Saturday and I said I don't know the words they said well we'll teach them we’ll teach ‘em I said I know the part I can do the part that's no problem because I'd played on the sessions and I knew most of the songs I mean you know instrumentally I’ll do it but they wanted me to play bass and I had played bass before I'd went on a tour with Rick Nelson in Japan playing bass and sing in harmony with him and I said I can handle a bass part but I didn't realize it was like you know patting your head and rubbing your stomach playing bass and singing that high part you know it was madness but it worked out great you know I just kind of just did the part you know and it worked out fine and maybe within a couple of weeks I had all the lyrics down pretty well because it wasn't any of it really to interpret until they did the Pet Sounds album you know then when they started doing the good the heavy stuff and it was great and I enjoyed it I think so definitely that that's a great album Pet Sounds em I played on actually four different single records of Good Vibrations I remember we were down in Gold Star which is uh it's not there anymore well Gold Star recording studios when he was putting the barre it was all done separate somewhat were done it was done over United and Western recording studios and just sitting there playing I just think radio’s too fragmented the people's taste haven't changed good good songs and good music will be but it would still be coming home you know you could call I I was on the pop charts and the country charts and the MOR charts at one time I was looking at billboard or cashbox I had ten eight albums in the top ten in the country charts and five albums in the top ten in the pop charts and that was because of television and they played me on country MOR rock-and-roll and I didn't have my first number-one record in all three categories until Rhinestone Cowboy oh I don't know Rhinestone Cowboy or Southern Nights Wichita Lineman maybe Rhinestone Cowboys my philosophy song I heard that on the radio and just I almost wrecked my car I mean it was just the whole the the record and everything was you know I I could tell all the elements were there but I didn't think it was quite put together no offence Larry Larry wise wrote it it was his record I heard but I carried that with me for about a month and a half two months I was on this tour of Australia it's all I played was Rhinestone Cowboy cuz there there's been a load of compromising on the road to my horizon now this was through the you know that would been from 68 to 74 and more there had I met with a TV with managers with agents with you name it and as in second verse says there will be a load of compromising on the road to my horizon but I want to be where the light is shining on me I just thought that would just blew me away you know and know every crack and a dirty sidewalks a Broadway which I I did you know that was so that's I think that's a timeless song yeah that's true I did a music show on NBC which a friend of mine John Pike he's a head of Paramount television now he was a vice president in NBC and he was all gung-ho on this music show right in the middle of it right in the middle of the second day shoot and we've done three shows and three shows 30-minute music show supposed to be Saturday night access you know he quit or he got he got offered the job at Paramount and it went right in the tank so we did 20 maybe 26 shows and it was aired it's a prime access 6:30 to 7 and in the east yeah but anyway I got more comments on that show because I just got to do any kind of music and I'd have one guest on it was a 30 minute show and uh but it's that's there and people in the business would say nope I like that Glenn it's Corden to who you're talking to whether it makes any difference or not to me to me like when somebody comes up and I know they know what they're talking about it yeah I say well thank you that gives me encouragement they want to hear Glenn Campbell be Glenn Campbell and saying what Glenn Campbell sings I’m I have my stuff is still played on on country and the MOR stations all the easy listening stations and they expect me to do those in which I do I'm so fortunate to have songs that like like Gentle On My Mind I love to sing Gentle On My Mind I love to say those words I love to do by the time I get to Phoenix Jimmy Webb’s songs are so melodically great the melody is so good the chord progression is so good and Jimmy Webb is I think is the best musical poet ever to be born and raised in America on a farm I saw my first indoor toilet when I was about nine years old I thought it was a cased offspring in the house it was unusual on the farm you didn't raise it you didn't eat it it was really dad all dad bought was like flour and salt and pe- pe- and pepper yeah I'm one of 12 I never knew what it felt like to sleep alone till I got married Bob a lot of truth in that statement and it was we weren't poor actually but we were but you didn't know it at the time because I was very happy we entertained ourselves playing and singing everybody the family played and sing by the time I came along I think about seventh part was left so that probably would train my ear for singing harmony or bass or whatever but it was a great great life growing up that way you know it wasn’t fast you know we wouldn’t it wasn't fast you know we wouldn't eat we went anywhere when I was a kid it was with a wagon and team I can remember my being in Mama's arms when I was like two and a half three years old I can remember that drive into the all-day singing and dinner on the ground things every May 1st May of every every year first Sunday of May every year they'd have an all day singing on general the ground somewhere you know we drive 30 the wagon in team 30 miles to do that em it was what I would get on the radio though we’d get st. Louis we’d get the Grand Ole Opry we’d get that on Saturday night em the local stations but it was whatever we could get Grand Ole Opry was all country and it was mainly bluegrass then em little Jimmy Dickens I remember a lot of his early stuff I liked the guitar work on it em Eddy Arnall em Hank Williams later em Hank while side alive I remember that was one of the biggest I used to do when I was a kid right whatever that is no it was it was the big band era that was definitely I'm big fan oh Glenn Miller stuff boy oh I thought that was marvelously marvellously constructed of the four freshmen boy what a what a sound it's where Brian Wilson got all of his harmonies from was same voicing as Glenn Miller's orchestra only did it with voices the Summer Smothers Brothers Show em Tommy Smothers put together a cast of writers I I'd known Tommy and Dickey had played on one of their albums Lou Adral reproduce to them I think and uh he said uh he saw me on Joy Bishops late-night show uh and uh he said can you talk I said sure I'm talking to you and he said can you read cue cards I said that I've got too many big words well I had to look it up they had the line I was supposed to say in this show called Ronald Reagan is the known heterosexual well I had to look it up right anyway said I don't to say that and Tommy was like he said it's okay believe me Glenn it's alright because I'm talking I'm out of the sticks Bob the writers on the show he put together Steve Martin Rob Reiner Mason Williams as well the head writers Tommy Pat Paulsen wrote Lee French still in the mirror Jack Byrnes Avery Shriver and Alan Thicke was a matter on the show all I had to do was come out say you know hi I'm Glenn Campbell and do what I do I didn't have to do anything controversial and that's I think that's what honed the audience in on Glenn Campbell I was the good old boy out of the out of the show I wasn't controversial leave French to the controversial stuff or Pat Paulsen did the controversial political stuff but I told Tommy I didn't wanna get involved in that I wanted to play and sang and introduce guests and I felt that wasn't who I was and my dad you know always said Glen trait the other fella like you'd like to be treated and you'll get along in life I mean it was just my upbringing Gurley and I'm I'm still that way of course I'll talk about people sometimes you know I'm not about that but they were just in Tommy he he wrote a show around Glen Campbell it's like a horseshoe all I need to do was stand in the middle and I was covered em as opposed to Dolly Parton show they wrote a show and put Dolly Parton in it that won’t work if that later on when Tommy when CBS fired Tommy Smothers which was a you know my my producer died literally because Tommy was producing the show he was producing the Glen Campbell goodtime hour and uh they wanted everybody out they wanted Tommy Smothers out of the good Glenn Campbell goodtime hour Tommy gave me the show didn't have it planned I mean not one red cent and it was really amazing to me Tommy Smothers is the best television producer I've ever seen John Wayne was you know if you got to pull a name out of a hat John Wayne and Lucille Ball oh uh Tom Jones was impressive I'd like Tom Jones’s a great singer Willie Nelson they’d come down if they wanted me to cut out some of the country in other words make the show more sophisticated but I found out it wasn’t coming from CBS it coming from my ex manager you know who wanted to make me the big-time go out don't go out with your guitar you look too country don't do this don't do that I was saying I got to do what I do I got to do what's real but anyway uh it was a total different ballgame you know when they started changing the show around John Wayne's daughter was a big fan of the goodtime hour and John Wayne brought her down to the studio to meet Glen Campbell and you talk about impressed because I used to pick cotton on to get money it cost a dime to get in the movie that Delilah and to see John Wayne and it was just a big thrill thrill thrill of my life to meet John Wayne and he was John Wayne was instrumental in me getting the part in True Grit oh it was a dollar 110 pounds ten pounds I worked real hard all day and make maybe 90 cents yeah daylight the dark for some reason I just I'm not a very good cotton picker I mean really and John Wayne was instrumental in doing that and how Hollis you know he had tried Fabian he tried Frankie Avalon he'd tried Rick Nelson and they didn't give him the push that I gave him you know cuz John Wayne had been nominated for an Oscar before but he hadn't had that push you know from a fellow actor to really make him come across enough to win the Oscar I said thought it's funny that I made John Wayne look so good in True Grit he won his only Oscar you know I take myself out of a movie it was on air far back I took myself out of the movie you know my that in other words that's not me up there and it was I enjoyed the movie for the first time you know I have to see him 20 times in preview yeah this this is that we became great friends on that show and oh Robert Duvall first day Hathaway was a hollower God rest his soul Henry Hathaway he was a holler and just screamed and hollered at everybody but it's mainly the extras people who couldn't talk back or couldn't say anything back but the first time he screamed at Robert Duvall I laughed man because they've all was right in his face and called him every name and some had never heard of and some I couldn't even pronounce and here they were it was like a referee and a ballplayer it was like you would be fined if you touched the other one and they were in each others face and his spit was coming out and you're real and Henry dips enough for something at that time I never heard such cussing and arguing in my life and dhoop looked at me and he said the boys got spunk dony I'm talking about Duvall but Duvall and I became very friends and Henry never yelled at me after that he didn’t yell at me and I’d say hey I'm here I've never done this before ask tell me what to do don't yell at me what to do cuz that's the first movie I've ever been in you know oh well that was they were fun you know I look at ‘em as well the Hal well I had two more movies to do with Hal it was a no it was a five picture deal and I did two Norwood I said okay Hal I called it mr. Wallace I said you got two more you got you got a football player and a guitar player and singer now who's gonna do the acting in this film and I said you know if it’s okay would do Joe Willie he’s a great guy he is a great guy great guy and why Kim Darby was in that one too so that it but the whole storyline you know I just thought when I was reading the script then I found out the only reason that how Wallis could do True Grit was if he did Norwood which was also written to Charles Portis who wrote True Grit well I was the guinea pig to do Norwood you know a guy wanted to get on the Louisiana Hayride with a pet chicken I just thought you know and you ever worked with the chicken oh very good premise especially and they want to set the chicken on your guitar neck you know like you gotta have a gimmick to do everything I said where does the chicken come in I said I said how the story none crap on the stage you know crap on your clothes I mean that was all she ever done to me eh it was just one of those things and I said Hal the stories have to get a little heavier than this you know I think something like get my claws into and I really at this I didn't want to do any more films they they’re funny I've issued there humorous I laugh at them but to get to work with Pat Hingle and and and guys like that uh you know I just I love to work with the with the guys that's character actors they’re so good uh Huddleston David David Huddleston what a great actor to work with these guys ug it was a big thrill well I worked I did ug traveling lady or something I don't I think it was baby the rainbow must fall Steve McQueen that was my first one I guess early sixties I was a sideman you know an extra and all that jazz but I did it I was a guy in his band and it it was a thrill to be there but boy but when he got up on the John Wayne level at you know I realized I was out of my element I'm a guitar player not a  singer John Wayne was was better in person than he was on screen I thought I mean he was so he was incredible you could not separate the two I mean seeing John Wayne in a movie would be just like talking you're talking to him here on the set if you could ever done it with John Wayne you you’d understand what uh what I'm saying well you do anyway but he was definitely he was as you couldn't separate the two fine fine human being boy I'm telling you he’s one of the the all-time great people that I have ever met he was honest he was you know if he didn't like you you knew it if he liked you you knew it he always knew where he stood with you you always knew where you stood with him very fast I mean you know if four words come out of your mouth he's obviously been around long enough that old song I've been around enough to know it was it was ah well you had to prove yourself you had to prove yourself before you know he would do it but he was I loved him boy I thought he was something he was amazing if we did though pleased with a gun I never told the story on TV before we were shooting the rifle with the reins in his mouth oh no it was great scene in the movie he was on the back of the camera truck on a sawhorse and the reins were tacked to the to the sawhorse and the saddle was on it and everything was tied down and it was kind of funny look at your boot doctor yeah with the reins in his mouth on the sawhorse with the close-up a still man came up the guy's takes a still picture he goes click click and Duke if it had been bullets in it it had been all the same he pointed the rifle at him the pistol threw it at at him and then gone over the horse with one long at at 8,000 feet up and ran him down and got the camera and tore the film out of it even called him every name he could make of and said you know kind it would that picture would have been on the front of every newspaper in the world because it was kind of funny-looking him sitting on a sawhorse at the back of the camera truck everybody gave him space he never did he never did anything if he didn't like it he he’d tell you he could Hen Hathaway one day said Glenn come up on this side of the horse and do this and that and that and how the way didn't realize Duke the patch on that eye and in Duke come up and I hand in rain he says don't hand me the rain with that hand I got a patch on this side of my eye you know I said Henry told me to do it and he said well Henry don't know a damn thing either I said that mean I don't he said well I didn't mean it that way yeah he was just he'd tell you instantly you don't have to wonder where John Wayne stood with you it was Leon Russell and I and a gal gal studio gal named Jackie Ward made a lot of money of on them commercials I mean they were so much fun that thing ran national for I don't know two years network television next I’d just like to do keep doing music I have a contemporary Christian album out now in New Haven Records which Jimmy Webb wrote a couple of songs and it's it's open I don't have to aim the music at anybody I can say what I want to say and do it musically as I want to do it it's a really total freedom of my musical art form thank you I’m fine it’s good to be back well yeah actually I do I go to Nashville and listen to songs from publishers I get albums from every facet of the business whether it's pop rock or or country or easy listening and I just try to find songs I found gentle on my mind out of an album I found Rhinestone Cowboy out of an album something something the song has to it has to hit me yes right like the title song on the unconditional love the new album is a is a song that hit me it took me back to my great-grandpa Jesse Campbell you know because they showed me that unconditional love when I was a kid what the doctor said about swallowing the corn is true it will pass I stole a I stole a dime from out of my sisters purse and and rolled a wagon to the store when I was a little witty kid I’ll never forget it and I swallowed the diamond it scared me to death for two or three days but alas yes they will go no I'm actually a seventh son Lorraine my dad was a second son I'm one of 12 children no I think it's the seven is the number that you see a lot in the Bible and I have another idea what it means I know I've been terribly lucky and it seemed like I was standing on the right street corner at the right time or being at the right place at the right time during my life fighting and dancing oh I know some of the clubs have been at back east they would have a the chicken wire in front of the stage you know to keep the bottle from coming on yeah but our West they really didn't have that you know there were a lot of fighting and ah that's what they were every night there were shootings in the clubs knifings but they were rough places especially with with the cowboys and the Mexicans it was just one of those things one of those rivalry things well the cowboys and the cowboys you know  we'd play I remember we I used to play a a lot of the rodeo dances around New Mexico when I was with my uncle's band and I I remember in Espanola New Mexico which is about it’s the north of Santa Fe and I remember getting my guitar and crawling under the makeshift bandstand and and I was there for like 30 minutes before the police come and got the ride quell there was like that 17 went to the hospital and 30-something were arrested it was it was one of those brawls you know well if I'd have thought about golf I would have loved golf I’m a great golfing fan you you get what you're hitting in golf and I like that you know you don't get to three million up front to play the game you you get out there and if you don't play you don't eat yes thank you I’ll be forgetting this this is my old Asian model what was it that Mike song it’s a great song well it's evening for me because I just got over here yesterday evening yes I am oh yes I'm gonna go play Inverness the first time this time up in Scotland we're playing in uh Glasgow and Aberdeen and I took a helicopter once I rented a helicopter because it drives over there well the roads you know and we flew over well you know I could afford it at the time I could I was up there doing a show with Peter Alliss so I actually borrowed the helicopter I didn't pay for it and I went and saw the old castles and flying over and it's really extremely the beautiful beautiful big big country we flew over the herds oh I meant that not the size of the country itself the nation itself but just the mountains everything was so big and I'm glad actually my ancestors got out of there because it was rugged rugged country I noticed rusty over there she uses the smoke alarm for a timer does she yeah I I cook a little bit but ah yeah actually I cooked a about a week one time and I broke the dog from begging it's marvellous oh yes I love it no no I have our citrus trees  oranges and grapefruit and lime and lemon oh it is marvellous thank you oh I love it I had it last night locally yes they have some nice Italian restaurant what's the main spice in this maybe my dog will start begging again I love it that’s red bell peppers you call them right cause they have red chilli peppers it’s very very hot just regular sour cream huh so it’s all the things mixed up is that what you’re saying it's not layered by any means is it but where does the time go time flies when you’re having a big thyme oh thank you oh well that was the first crack out of a barrel I'd never done a movie Duke’s young daughter then she was a fan of the Goodtime Hour and Duke brought her down to the show and this is where I first met him and I didn't really you know I certain parts of the movie I think that's okay you know but I know I'm not really an actor in fact I think that was my whole thing to do movies was I made John Wayne look so good in True Grit that he won his only Oscar oh definitely John Wayne was really the number one of them  well John Wayne's the he was a very he stood for quote America and for the values that the forefathers wrote I mean he was very outspoken on that you know if anything the new legislature and stuff come up he wouldn't he would call the the man and talk to them about it because he was for the way that it was because it seems like I know my children are not growing up in the same with us under the same rules and regulations that I had to grow up under you know it changes and I'm sure it does here in Great Britain too it changes it seems like every decade there's another set of rules for the kids to grow up under you know personally I think dr. Spock will run about two generations of children myself well they're getting away they're they're following man-made laws and man-made rules that we're getting away from the basics of what God our Creator told us how to act and how to be I think we’re definitely losing discipline ah and losing moral codes well you know just from from living you know 50 years just seeing the change and the different codes we have to live under you know taking prayer out of school I think was a bad thing ah I think children should be taught morals from the word go you know not like they're they're teaching in schools you know they're you know give them condoms and so forth I think that's ludicrous why do they think the suicide rate in teenagers is going up that's mainly the problem their their access to drugs their access to liquor they're not taught this at a young age this is my fourth year in a row and I come over for like three weeks and I've told you off Kruger the promoter that I wanted to play places in towns that I hadn't been before cause I kind of get a different view I can’t I come over and once and I did Brighton and Albert Hall and I said that isn't right I I want to get out in the bushes I want to get out in the small towns I play the Channel Islands and they’re marvellous well I'm ah Roger Miller had an old joke said I'm independently filthy anyway so I don't need to mind so I'm gonna go right I don't need the wire netting so no I know actually wanted to go to the Channel Islands to see what they were like and I went ah two years ago and they're marvellous thank you
