what was sort of picked up originally is em they thought we we’d be a good pop rock type of you know play a bit of rock ’n’ roll a bit of pop but that’s how we did start and em you can see it in the attire in the early clips when you’re kids you wanna  get up you do whatever it takes to get into you know get get signed up and take and get on the road and that was we were really happy that time if we could just work in clubs for the rest of our lives that was better than our day jobs you know what I mean and we could travel so we thought if we could accomplish that touring around the world just doing clubs hey we we’ve got a life you know so everything else became a bonus after that even Bon came into the picture 6 months later evident you know we had we had to like the key then to just go straight to rock ’n’ roll because he could deliver it you know and he had his own style and his own you know and he influenced the band on where to go more into the rock ’n’ roll thing as well no it’s from when we got there but we we were running you know and we were that was the idea was to get a bit of press as well but it was a good idea you know and then just recently we had one they stuck us in the hammer in New York you know we’ve done this already we know this shot you know can you come up with something better you know but em but that worked it it really did it’s one of them in fact the the track went to number one you know up to em it stayed there for ages you know it’s been covered tons of times by other artists we were told it was gonna be in a church which we thought was great but when we got there at the end of that video with Bon on the pope he nearly gets up to the top and then he jumps he broke his ankle and that’s the last in a way it was good in a way because it was at the end of the video it was the last thing he had to do and after that he was draft off to hospital and the record company would send us the pink jacket you know for we’d sent the album back album cover for six times each week and not not till the final week when it comes black it’ll be right all black no nothing on it you wanted in post so you don’t need white lines on it em you know it was all of that shit we settled for it in the end for a slight grey liner on the side but even there the presence were going on the whole thing so we we’d managed to get for then what we wanted yea well we toured in the states for six month with the back in black and I think it was the week we left it it it came in about 129 or something it hung move up 2 move up 3 and by the time we finished it was around 50 in the States and when we got back to Australia about 3 weeks later it was number 1 or number 2 in the charts and we were saying oh that must be a misprint you know think that was ours but it was real so we were all shaft about that but of course the band were all around the world in different places it’s not like we can all go and have a celebration or anything you know we just thought well well we’ll find out when the check comes won’t we well I thought Thunderstruck was like the max he took it to the max then you know with the big you know and all the kids behind there just the stuff you know he just had his you know he’s really good at coming up with things and as soon as he tell you about it you’re expecting okay here we go what are we gonna get you know we’re gonna get snow dropping on you we’re gonna get but he he you know he come in the first thing he do when he comes in you know I’ve been listening to his songs now for two days you know look look I’ve got this bit and I’ve got that bit but what’s that next bit you know and he he he gets you he’s not always sitting so he’d learned the guitar of it then he’d go to work you know he really does he he’s the best director we’ve ever worked with you know
