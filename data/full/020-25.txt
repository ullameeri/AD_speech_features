he was very special to me mainly because I read about him and admired him as millions of Americans did who saw what a man he was he was a great coach as you course know uh but more than that he was a fine family man uh he was a man who loved his country and he set a magnificent example for people all over the country uh I think that if you were to pick one man who has more caught the imagination of uh the nation in the field of sports it's probably been Slum Barty because of his character oh I re- I remember so well the time that I met both Y E Tittle and Andy Robert Sully was in your apartment Frank in New York in 1962 you know in those years you know those great giant teams I don't mean they aren't so great now but well they were championship in my book and I recall a the great time we had and what fun it was just to sit there and talk but well I've often thought that if I had my life to live over again and didn't go into politics I'd like to have your job you know be a sportscaster writer well possibly if I'm not too old you'll give me the chance I'm later yes oh what are yours you know right next to Southern Cal is a small college but uh with a very fine football tradition and my coach chief Newman of course was an alumnus of your college or university enriched a Southern California as a matter of fact he was an All-American a great player he played a a tackle and and fullback both in the days when they went both ways each he played a tackle on defence and pull back on offence but the chief uh in a very interesting way was a lot like Lombardi uh he was a fellow who produced good teams uh I think the thing that I remember most about him was his attitude about being a good loser he said you ought to be a good loser but being a good loser to him he says you got a hate to lose you got a hate to lose and get up off that floor and come back to fight again and he got that into everyone who ever played for him or as I did sat on the bench was on the taxi squad and I think perhaps that may have had an effect on me I had to lose a widow before I won well first Frank as president I have to be very nonpartisan and when I go to a game consequently it's very difficult cuz I like to be for a team for a man or for a team I don't mean being so much against the other team but for somebody I know uh but what I have now decided is the best rule is to be for the team in which the city I happen to be living now that's the Washington Redskins at the present time with George Allen who incidentally you remember coached at Whittier before he went on Chicago Bears it's a defensive coach and then on to the Rams and now not otherwise the Redskins uh I will have told him I'm going to come out to the a I'm gonna root for the Redskins but let me say that when I'm in Los Angeles I'm rooting for the Rams uh or when I'm in San Diego and with the Chargers you name it and I'll be there well I think it's nice that she is going to be here tonight and I think also Frank speaking of the fact that Vince Lombardi was such a wonderful family man a deeply religious man uh that this is his 31st wedding anniversary it would have been denied so the fact that he's in the Hall of Fame that she's here on this day which must have meant so much to both of them I think is very significant
