well I am so good how is everybody this morning I'm just just delighted to be here thank you so much thank you oh yes I'm excited about that too looking forward to that well it means that you know I've been identified as one of the black women who's involved in something who's doing something a woman with energy etcetera etcetera all of that is this kind of a black woman recognition that's a long story you know prior to being in the House of Representatives I was in the State House I was in the legislature and I ran for that seat uh right at the height of the women's movement a long time ago before you all were born and so you know it really was at the height of the women's movement and women were being encouraged to run and I was in the headstart program and I'd been organizing uh in the communities getting mothers involved getting parents taking control of their children's educational destiny and all of that and so one of the members of the California State Assembly decided to resign got into some problems and of course I was encouraged to run and the women were saying why don't you run why don't you run and that member who resigned uh took his administrative assistant uh to the Secretary of State's office at the last minute we didn't know that he was not going to run his administrative assistants signed up he was the only one in the race race closed down and of course we got together women and said no this is not right they opened it back up a woman who was a Secretary of State opened it back up for five days I signed up and everything else is history I ran yeah no looking back that's right well it has it has changed significantly but you have to talk about how it has changed what's what's happening with the change it is social media it's you young people it's the Millennials it's a different way of communicating and connecting but of course some of the issues that we've been involved with whether it's voting rights or police brutality are some of those issues prison reform etc still exist I know and it it just happened I don't know what happened but uh somehow I connected and so you young people said you like what I'm doing you think so well I know that some people say oh you're so outspoken you're confrontational and I think what happened was this my career has always been one of challenge and I've always you know dealt up front with the issues but for a number of years my voice was not heard uh because I'm on the Financial Services Committee and we were dealing with many of the issues that don't get a lot of exposure uh we did get some exposure when we had the subprime meltdown and they had all the foreclosures and many communities are close to countries right but when we talk about Wall Street and we talk about derivatives and margins and all of that that's not sexy enough to be carried and so you know people didn't hear me for a long time because I was so concentrated on all of those issues but then when Trump showed up then I had to show up and I did show up oh oh listen you know as an African-American woman who has been involved in the struggle you know it's coming you know who they are and you know how not to let it devastate you and you build the strength uh to fight back to push back and let it just go over your shoulders you know it's not something that's going to put me in the bed and so my god every day I wake up I wake up energized well let me just say they said one time that was redlining this was years ago where they literally drew a line around communities and said we're not lending to those communities and of course those are black communities right a minority communities they just didn't think that you were capable of paying a mortgage and so we fought that we fought that very hard and we undid redlining and then they discovered there's money in those communities right and they came back with the subprime loans said you can get some money but it's going to cost you more and we were targeted so that we were paying more interest rates for our loans despite the fact we had equal income equal employment paid our debts as well as other people so we were we were treated very poorly and then of course with the subprime lending there was a meltdown uh because of the way that they did it they literally went overboard and they said we're gonna lend to everybody because we can get Wall Street to buy these loans and so what they did was it was fraud a lot of fraud involved a lot of making up of what the income was despite the fact it was not really that just sign on the dotted line they didn't vet them they had um you know vet loans no vet loans etc so they built a lot of paper and they got a lot of people to sign on the dotted line they packaged those from the community banks and other banks and they sold them up to Wall Street and Wall Street had people invest in them and of course the devil came due on those people down here who got into those easy loans where the they reset and the interest rates went up people couldn't afford to pay any more than they could afford when they signed up for the loan and so they lost their homes and the devastation was you know overbearing it was just outrageous how many homes got foreclosed on during that period of time but we have to deal with these banks in these financial institutions these are people who have gotten away with the kind of policies that cause us not to be able to get loans for so many years these are the robbers on Wall Street these are the gangsters on Wall Street these are the people who find another way to figure out how to get your money and not to um give you what you deserve but the money that you're paying so we're constantly fighting that's what the uh dodd-frank reforms are all about in Congress when it came to the point where so many people were losing their homes and we had all this devastation going on uh senator Dodd and Barney Frank got together with this legislation I was a part of that on the conference committee where we went through everything we could go through to find out what had happened and so we came up with a lot of laws and it is the dodd-frank reform law but we're being resisted by the Republicans who are in bed with the banks and we're saying there are certain things you can't do you can't do these kind of loans anymore but we're resisted we have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that's paying attention they're fighting him mr. Cordray who heads that is really good he's been doing a great job but we're up against it so what can we do first thing we got to do is get rid of Trump um he well yeah Minuten was before my committee as you know he's a Treasury secretary he's for getting rid of the reforms uh this president is for getting rid of the reforms they've got Goldman Sachs and everybody you know that's in government now more than ever before and they're running it they're telling them what to do and so we've got to get rid of this administration we've got to get rid of those who control our committees like Zeb penciling on my financial services committee so that we can have an opportunity to get back into lending and we've got to support minority banks I believe in banking black and I got in trouble because I believe in it so much oh yeah doing the uh bailout when uh there was a a bank that basically lost fifty million dollars overnight because it was taken over by Fannie Mae uh and they came to me for help I called the Treasury and they investigated me and it went on and on and on uh and finally of course I was exonerated I had not done anything wrong but I believed in black banks I work very closely with the NBA and uh I want to make them have more access to capital so they can put more money out in our communities and it's tough it's rough but it is a fight that we have to engage in well we got a bank with them that's number one we got to do our business with these black banks and make sure uh that they are viable and make sure that they're able to provide the loans that we need in order to invest in in home purchases you know that's one of the ways that we may gain wealth is you buy a house that house is going to appreciate for the most part and particularly in certain states when you build up that equity and you have money not only uh to pay your mortgage but now you can sell that house you can borrow on that house you may have money to invest in a business uh to send your kids to college what have you so home ownership is extremely important and doing that subprime meltdown that we went through that recession blacks lost a significant portion of their wealth well you know that's been said and it's not that so much that we don't trust each other it's a constant educational process about how we can help each other how we can strengthen our communities and how to go about pooling our resources and so it's not that we don't trust each other we've not had the opportunity to invest in viable businesses and ways by which we could create well and we have to keep working with each other we have to keep learning and we have to keep believing that we can really do this well it's because you know there was a certain sensitivity about him and I got to know his mom and when he did that song that he did that talked about his mom dear mom mom mom was about baby she was my queen of course yeah that really struck me uh as somebody who not only was brilliant inspired and all of that it had a real sensibility in a heart and understanding that a lot of people don't have you know when you can you know recognize that your mom is in trouble but also recognize that that is your mother and you do everything that you can for her uh that many people will fall into trouble and I have this theory that when people do better they do better and so you know a lot of mothers don't know any better unfortunately young oftentimes I have children and so Tupac Tupac for me I was very special and um he was smart and I just I loved him did you um you know of course yeah of course I meant Tupac as a matter of fact they used to do a Mother's Day program um in Los Angeles a number of the rappers who would always invite me and I'd go yeah I was I was one of the defenders of rap music even when it was gangster music because I thought it was creative and I thought that it opened up a whole new economic opportunity for black people where jobs and positions were created when they wouldn't play rap music on some of the major uh stations and so uh and I don't believe in censorship so I I had to go up against see Delores Tucker and some of those who were trying to censor rap music but I always knew it would evolve and you know back in the day with Queen Latifah and all of them oh we're finding themselves look at them now I mean look how they have evolved well I think censorship is unconstitutional and I think it's a way of quietening voices uh that maybe people in power don't want to hear because it potentially interferes with their ability to do what they do and to say what they want to say and to exercise power in certain ways and so when you have people who are willing to challenge the establishment uh that is potentially dangerous for the establishment so no I don't believe in censorship of any kind no I really don't I mean I mean I'd like it but I feel like this what you don't want to hear don't listen to it you know what I'm saying yeah yeah yeah what you don't want your kids to hear or see shut it down uh but when you start to talk about limiting voices and opinions uh I think that's dangerous in a in a democracy well first of all forget about what Trump wants to do because he sent mixed messages to his own uh caucus I think what you see now is an understanding that the Senate is not going to be able to pass anything now we have a group that's emerged that's calling themselves bipartisan Democrats and Republicans who have come up with some ways uh by which to uh change some of the Obamacare and to deal with some of the concerns we never thought Obamacare was perfect uh and we don't like to see the premiums rise and we want insurance companies to stay involved and we always said to them we're willing to work with you they didn't want to work with us but now I think we see them some of them who want to work with us to see what we can come up with yeah yes of course we have ounces what do we have to lose just take a look at Jeff Sessions it's Attorney General who is trying to rollback voting rights uh who does not believe in consent decrees consent decrees is what allow you to go into areas like Ferguson where you have had rogue cops and try and straighten out those Police Department's the Justice Department would come in they would point out all of the things that they were doing that were harmful and they will try and work out an agreement with them that they will stop certain practices they will do certain kind of trainings they would get rid of bad cops but Jeff Sessions doesn't want to do that anymore he says that's interference and local police jurisdictions and we shouldn't do it uh also uh in addition to that he wants to rollback affirmative action and so what do we have to lose mr. Trump everything a lot let me just say this for some of us who saw that this was a deplorable human being early on in the campaign where he mimicked and mocked a disabled journalist talked about grabbing women by their private parts stalked Hillary Clinton talked about his colleagues little Rubio called him names etc we believe that he certainly should not be President and did not think he would be president but we knew that this was a man with no good values and so when he became president of course we were shocked and we were surprised but I started right then talking about he should be impeached because not only the way that he conducted himself during the campaign but we learned a lot about his allies and his associates who had ties to Russia and to the Ukraine and to oil and so I knew uh that this someone who had been involved with collusion with the Russians in undermining our democracy and of course 17 of our intelligence agencies said that they certainly had hacked into the DNC and even the RNC and so I believe that he should be impeached and I said it early on and of course I've been criticized by Democrats and Republicans and everybody but now bit by bit drip by drip it's coming home to roost and let me tell you I do think it is possible Republicans some of them are frightened some of them don't know what to do I think they're absolutely concerned but here's what I'm challenging you claim to be patriotic you think you wave your flag higher than anybody else you talk about you're the most patriotic and some of us out here are not as patriotic as you are I'm challenging you are you going to stand by and watch this man destroy the democracy are you going to stand by and watch him join with Putin to undermine the democracy in the interests of drilling oil in the Arctic he told Putin that he would lift those sanctions now Putin has mad at him because we had a bill that stops him from lifting the sanctions and he could not back away from it because not only was Russia in it we also had in there bill North Korea and uh we had one uh of one Other country Russia was Russia and it was North Korea and who was the third one oh it was a Iran Iran Iran all in the bill so with uh North Korea being such a threat and with so much support for increasing the sanctions on Iran he couldn't back off even if he wanted to protect Russia now Putin is mad at him now let's see what Putin has on him uh because you know their allegations about a dossier uh that may be available and other kinds of things so I believe it is possible to impeach him how long is it going to take I don't know but I give it to about December I give it to December our new Special Counsel mr. Muller uh hasn't panelled a grand jury as you know as of yesterday and they will be involved with investigations and they can do indictments also so little by little drip by drip is happening uh could be and we'll get him next well you know that's typical of what he did during the campaign remember when the protesters uh went to his campaigns and he told that people to beat him up and said so much he'd get him out of jail in essence if they did this is consistent with his character and that is promoting violence and I think it was wrong I said so I tweeted about it uh but this is who he is I mean this is a man that's capable of almost anything and so I don't like it I don't think it's right we have been the victims of so much violence uh and we've had unarmed men killed particularly unarmed young black men and so I think that was you know whistling to them to keep doing it uh to keep treating them harshly and so I'm opposed to it and I'll continue to speak out about it I think that it has to be a combination uh legislators are elected to create public policy to go to Washington DC and fight for those things that are in the best interest of everybody and particularly those communities from which they are elected but the activists in the street are the ones who really give them the backup that they need if you take a look at the Tea Party or the uh freedom fund they have people in the street who really fight for them you take the gun owners they are organized they keep pressure on their elected officials they work with their elected officials and too often our folks are not at the table certainly but are not organized are not working we depend kind of on well the NAACP are you know  what I like about the Millennials now is I see this organizing going on even though a lot of it is in the social media that's good we have to be active we have to be involved we have to say what we don't like don't let politicians just come uh to your church and give a uh Bible verse and everybody say Amen and people go home ask them what did you to ask them about their votes take a look on at uh their records and see who they are what they care about what are they leading on the more the communities are involved the better your politicians will be well I think there was not enough interaction I think that he had great potential uh I think once people elected him they simply said now we've elected him and he'll get it done and they didn't realize that not only do you have the Congress and the legislature and all of that but they needed the same young people who got involved in the campaign to be involved in now helping to direct and organize public policy no not at this point you've got to show that you're willing and you're able to put the numbers together and exercise your influence we still are not voting our influence yet I think what we should do is organize our power exercise our power uh particularly in the Democratic Party because that's where most of us are we should go to the conventions we should be delegates uh we should run for office do all of that and then you can raise that kind of question whether or not we're strong enough to talk about organizing another party oh I don't know there are a lot of people who are talking about it you've got Kamala Harris and Gory Booker and everybody you've got a lot of folks who're gonna run well they'll have some good people I think I have work to do and let me just say this uh I'm considered controversial and confrontational that's right but you know what I need to do is kind of what I do and that is create the challenge open up the discussion and encourage people and let those who you know are willing to be a a little bit more um cooperative in the way that they handle this complicated political system in order to move forward so I'm good where I am I'm ok well I think the question of the legalization of marijuana is just about over it is what it is it's happening you have states that have already legalized California now Colorado some other states it's it's to pay to complain that is it and the federal government may as well recognize that because it's happening what do you think Cory from the president oh I think he should run if he wants to run I think she should run if she wants to run well you know that's you know how the democracy is organized according to the Constitution and all so-called states rights rights where states have the ability to create their own laws but what really bothers me is the killing of a black man who was in a state where you can have a gun you can possess a gun he said I have a gun he told him and because I think it was an African-American man he was killed because no matter the law you're not supposed to have a gun and so I really don't like guns I really don't like guns think that the more that you know people possess guns the more they going to use them and I wish that we could shut it down I really do I understand what you're saying the differences in the various states um and they have a right to create their own laws the federal government can override all of that I just think in our community we must not only educate about guns and be aware of the violence that takes place and work very hard to do everything that we can to tell folks this is not the way to solve a dispute this is not the way to deal with uh the fact that somebody has you know dis you uh we cannot kill each other no yeah we do have some security but I tell them you know if you've got to shoot you better shoot straight because of wounded animal is the worst thing you can deal with so the worst I've ever experienced yes I do I really do because I think he believes in nothing uh I think that he cares about nothing I think that he's capable of uh doing outrageous things and so I even with you know presidents that you could accuse of racism etc this president is the worst that I've ever seen yes oh yeah well you know they're after me as a matter of fact that coalition of alt-right groups that's headed by Bannon who's in this administration and others will do everything that they can to discredit me and this is going to go on for as long as I'm outspoken as long as I'm out there so we can hear we're going to hear a lot about Maxine Waters and they'll make up things uh but that's okay I'm prepared to deal with it well that should you have sessions I mean he's a throwback uh this is a man who has a record and a history of racism of uh being opposed to voting right and I mentioned when I tweeted Coretta Scott King who warned us and told us when he uh attempted to be confirmed for Attorney General back in the 60s uh that he should not be confirmed because of his record of racism uh etc so I don't think much about him I think that does he's a danger uh to us and much of what we have gained and what we have fought for and while uh you know they're fighting on the inside and Trump wants uh to fire him uh because he recused himself and he thinks that you know uh Sessions is not doing enough to protect him let them fight each other and let them explode I uh you know but no Jeff Sessions is dangerous the first thing black people have got to do is to understand that we are worthy uh that we are deserving and that we should have opportunities we should continue to fight against discrimination and we should challenge it and we should not be quiet I think uh many of our young people have been taught go to school graduate get yourself a good job don't make too much noise on the job you know fit in uh so that you can you know earn a decent salary and you can get a raise no life is about a lot more than that life is about not only aspiring to opportunity but not allowing people to dismiss you to undermine you uh to intimidate you that you have to find a way uh to not only speak up for yourself but to organize with others so that we can challenge injustice and so I think it's very important to get grounded to know who you are and you will be inspired to move in the right direction but if you are fuzzy and you you don't have confidence and you don't believe that you're worthy you're never going to be able to do the kind of challenging that will open up these opportunities and talk with other people so that people exchange what's going on in their lives and talk about how they handle certain things on the job how they're saving money and how they're trying to get involved with creating a business let's talk with each other let's work together let's believe in our communities and in the struggle that has taken place to get us where we are today I think we can do all of this I'm a very optimistic person no matter how bad it seems I wake up every morning energetic and ready to take on the fight well I think that's very important uh I think we can not only pool our resources we can get involved in joint ventures again we can support our our local banks and our black banks uh and we can do more to work together our communities need economic development and economic development really does come out of a desire by people to own things and to have businesses and to create jobs and of course you can look for resources to support that but we need to initiate these opportunities and where we have gentrification we push back on it and say no you're not coming in here we're going to do the development we're going to create the businesses but it really does take that kind of of a belief in oneself  we do do this and we can't say we can't I mean we must believe in ourselves and so yeah well let me tell you what happened and this is a time when uh elected officials can exercise some power Comcast was coming in to do the big merger with NBC Universal and when they come through they have to go to the FCC and they have to lobby the Congress of the United States to give them support and we said wait a minute you know we don't have enough ownership we don't have enough blacks in management and so we worked with them and we thought we Cohen over in uh Comcast a lot until we got them to come up with a way by which they were going to open up these opportunities they formed a memorandum of understanding with some civil rights groups that was not that good uh because they did not have the real business involvement and background by which to create you know these channels so we worked very hard in order to get this done and out of that uh came Magic Johnson's uh inspired and P Diddy's revoked well then we had one Latino Bob Rodriguez was all got created because of the struggles that we had and the fact that Comcast had to agree to something so that they would not continue to get the pushback we were doing I challenged them and I put together hearings in LA I went to Chicago and I was right there in their faces until they had to agree and look this is important because of the percentage participation of blacks uh with Comcast and with these cable channels we watch this we spend more money than anybody and so I'm just so pleased I didn't realize it was both radio and TV no but they I've been I've been at the studio in in Los Angeles in a revolt studio with all you young people and all the young people there and they're very kind and very nice and all of that and um you know I've talked to a P Diddy did say thank you and Andre Harrell has gotten us in touch with him so yeah we have a connection but we want it to be deeper and we want it to be more profound we're going to be talking to them my husband and I talked about that he's with me this morning uh his ambassador set new Williams he he played for the Cleveland Browns as a matter of fact Jim Brown introduced me to him many many years ago uh before I married him but we are concerned about the health and uh all the information that has been uh unveiled now about what happens to the brain uh because of those hits no I would not recommend my children to play football my grandchildren
