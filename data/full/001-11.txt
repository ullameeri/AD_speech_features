well she was my most recent date em that’s from the song Whole Lotta Rosie you know that went with the story with Bon from the em when the band was just kicking around in Melbourne in the seven four early seventy four and we were all broke all the time we were staying in and em and I remember Bon you know he he he he’d say you know there’s a couple of girls you know one’s pretty one’s ugly one’s sort of cute but she’s here you see and they’ve offered to make his dinner so em to cut the long story short at the end of the night after dinner and drinks big Rosie grabs Bon says right you’re mine for the night and I run away from the other one I I went home and em and Bon woke up in the morning squashed against the wall this big girl in a single bed and em so he he and he tried to get away and she grabbed him again got you know got more pain in for for a meal so when he come back and tell all this we said oh we gotta get a song title of that this one Bon so you know so it came out a Whole Lotta Rosie so we knocked it together pretty quick in the studio and knocked it together in half an hour we laid down in the studio pretty quick it’s just it was just rock and you know so but we added some music from the session before and we felt it was really good the music we never had a good lyric for it but as soon as this Rosie thing happened we went this is the song for it so we stuck it up at this backing track we got and em and that was it so and it’s so unfortunate we never had it with Bon we never had a Rosie inflatable we we really didn’t have the money for production at the time but when we got Brian in and everything and Back in Black was success of it we decided to get get a big fat Rosie up on the stage and Bon will have a nice little chuckle with that and you know he was looking down you know and the and the fans love it you know they loved it
