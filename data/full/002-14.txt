oh thank you yeah I still fumble over a few licks occasionally than you I appreciate it uh yeah Sandy Brokaw of the publicist he got me a tape of it and uh it's it's fine you know it's this it's like the book yeah and I say wow you know it's like oh definitely Tommy’s still the same way exactly used to laugh at me for playing golf and now he's the golf of nut it's amazing you realized sixty-eight Brian White wasn't born like six years later but they did a good job on it they really did I was I was pleased with the show they didn't they showed some of the bad stuff but thank God not all of it yeah she started doing it um about three or four years ago she's well when Anne-Marie and I were doing a tour of England and she was like 15 at the time and I took her around with us in Ireland she was going to school in Lakenheath and I took her over to Ireland with us and some of the she's with us almost a whole trip and boy she wanted to be in showbiz then so oh yeah they they told me a guy from England called it uh what I forget the neighbourhood company now it won't he sent me a list of like 20 songs to do a TV album for for Europe um Jack Jackson a guy here in town he did the arrangements and we did things like Feelings and Without You You've Lost That Loving Feeling a time in a bottle and that kind of stuff and I've got a tape of the album now I stick at my car and it just brings back such memories I don't even sometimes don't know it's me singing you know but can you imagine me singing yeah we start September 10th for three weeks then I'll wait and then three more weeks in October right we're here at the theatre Geno theatre right here in Nashville oh yeah she's I I like I had cue cards no I I like her and I love her and she really is an asset to my show because we get to sing the harmony we get to do the stuff I did with Anne-Marie and um with Bobbie Gentry and and she really does a great job in this my daughter ladies gentlemen Debbie Campbell I did I didn't I encouraged her one way or the other I just think if she wanted to do that fine you know because I didn't get to be around her much when she was a little girl so I'm getting the best part now I don't have to go through all that teenage stuff we that’s exactly right well she was um um her mother married a guy in the service so she was in Germany she was all over the world so that's in fact if it was a pleasure to go to England because I hadn't seen her for about two years I don't look a day over 59 and a half she did one on the new album with me the the the one we're doing for England I'm gonna get it released here sometime we did Let It Be Mean I think it is oh definitely the genal harmony it’s it's amazing how quickly it it just came about this and it's the phrasing sounds um it’s it's really good I really enjoy singing with her I um and I really like for her I I mean she's such an asset to the shows like when you come to the show tomorrow I’m gonna make I'm trying to get her sing more on the show
