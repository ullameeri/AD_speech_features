well it was the first time the other day that I actually the the whole thing everything is terrible everything is awful and I suddenly thought about the theatre about this entire profession sort of almost being obliterated and particularly particularly all the kids I mean I’ve been thinking about all the people who might have just got into the raw value all the people have got their first television series or and then all the people who managed to get along because they're going to do pantomime but then you suddenly have the first time rewrite there’s no pantomime and it it suddenly dawned on you all those empty theatres everywhere how in earth is anybody ever going to get them back and up and running no no I mean the the pantomimes are the things that keep the theatre that theatre which every which are going for the rest of the year uh and if they don't have that I mean people people don't realize how much it costs to keep a theatre going and I'm sure the big theatres I'm sure the big boys in the theatre are looking after all the big theatres what worries me as they are about 700 little theatres uh in I don’t uh that may well just fall between the cracks and all the people that they employ and because it's sort of such a sounding if frothy little profession uh and we're worrying about everybody else all this all this dancers singers people who are backstage uh music everybody I mean uh
