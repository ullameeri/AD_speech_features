oh no I don't think so uh we're having a terrific variety of of scripts coming in and it really has to do with uh the the kind of material that you're dealing with really and I like Kolchak I like the character Kolchak and uh we have a lot of fun with it and apparently the audience seems to like him from from the uh of course the night stalker I enjoyed it so we're trying to keep up that level during the uh coming year I think we will I think we will oh I don't all kinds of things we're working on a zombie story now which is kind of fun uh we're also working a werewolf uh story uh we uh I just got an outline in which is I'm terribly excited about which is a uh a lady vampire which I think is kind of fun and I've known a few lady vampires haven't you I mean really no it's not he's alone it’s just though that part of his life takes place aw- away from the camera you know we're not who's interested in that you know we're not really well that that goes to the heart of the matter really as to what is the actor what is the character and in very often in the audience's mind people get the two mixed up the fact that an actor says something that he may not believe or follow you know wholeheartedly with his whole entire being himself but says it with utter total conviction people begin to think that he is Ronald Reagan you know what I mean and he's not really Ronald Reagan even though he may claim that let's get those uh or whatever he does you know with the mutts with the conviction of of the actor's work on it uh sure there are certain times that an actor has to say things that he doesn't believe or he doesn't really I mean after all that's the amount of acting isn't it I absolutely believe that there are things beyond our comprehension lying out there that we know nothing nothing about no not really I always liked myself a lot I never  yeah a little bit no I’m delighted and welcome to ABC
