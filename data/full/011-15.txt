well if you look it's it's got a kind of devil two little horns little red devil you know I always thought the HT was a lighter guitar because you could just pick it up like this uh I really wanted to play I suppose it was it was just something at the time here and you know a lot of rock and roll records in the house and uh you know I had older brothers who played and it just seemed like there was a guitar lying around the house you'd pick it up and try and get try and get a couple of notes out of it you know or try and emulate what you heard I really never sort of learnt um like in a technical sense like and it's you know theory or anything I just it was just something you know I'd look at some of my brothers look at the positions where their finger was new would you would hope that you would get it right yeah and uh Malcolm my brother he was pretty much the same and and I think cause of you know the two of is a little little fellas and uh you know you would try and make make chords and stuff if you're a little guy and you're playing a big big chord you got like a bit of a stretch you know and you you see some guys because they've got big big long fingers like an Eric Clapton or something you know the good it's big finger finger stretch and I you know almost but it looks better their their fingers for piano or something and uh when you're a little guy you know you you sort of go to try and compensate yeah and Malcolm and myself uh if it was a major like a major a chord little chords like that well I think with with guitar of course at the first I wasn't really that much interested to guitar is like s- solo guitar you know uh but I think uh it's when I a bit later on unit started hearing some of the Blues stuff and people like Elmer James and uh and for rock and roll you know obvious is Chuck Chuck Berry you know hmm you want a bit of Chuck I'll do my best and then you get that Chuck Chuck thing and uh that was uh probably I think for rock and roll and especially at a time it was probably you know uh everyone's you know the bulk of people's idols you know and other people I would hear later on like blue skies um you know the the the Freddy kings and you know like with him I think he's he had the the this sort of single note you know and uh which you see people like Clapton Lou and uh and then of course to this probably for the you know the space for its you got you know Hendrix you know with this sort of kind of uh you know to me it was a little bit kind of I suppose uh uh a surf sound in a way you know it had that you know the Hendrix thing and that kind of surfs surf thing but with a sort of you know probably a modern-day sixties twist you know with all the you know the freaking out with the whammy bar and the WoW pedals and and stuff but I'll try it I'm not a great Hendrix player but I'll try a little yeah they used to do a lot you would hear it in people like uh John Lee Hooker and things were they gonna say if you had it like the king baby thing so it was just more the the the groove of it and you could sort of say well I can bust through that you know so and I'll in and probably in my case if there there was a lot of you know was a lot of busking because even when we first started you know when we playing clubs and bars you know you know Malcolm he had more experience of playing around and uh you know we just do half a dozen you know rock and roll tunes and you know it said probably but a lot more volume you know and play two measures you know everyone used to say you know if uh you know is that a Chuck Berry song you were playing up there you know and you go yeah and again didn't sound like it you see well I suppose people you know with a you know of an average medium hight can sort of you know that when they bend that they best bend a string you know with with me it's like I've got a sort of girl you know you have to sort of lean and lean into it you know and uh a lot of people when you when you're playing on stage a lot of people say oh you move it's a lot of movement you know but it's actually me trying trying to get around the fretboard you know so in or if you do like a double you know  it's just uh I suppose a thing of nature you know when you when you play in life you know and then sometimes it's it's the movement itself that helps you get you know actually get the note or you think you know you know you you think of ways of trying to uh you know yeah well I've got to get that note how am I going to get out and you and some- and like well myself you know you you need sort of crunch up together and you sort of yeah yeah it's almost like a virgin' there you know if you had to get a you know an effect or something you would think of something you know that you could do with a guitar like in if you hit the song jailbreak you know there's like uh in the middle there's a there's a you know guitar break with the vocal thing you know when Bon he he was singing and you know he would do this heartbeat thing and then even you spotlight no I'd go you know you make a rude noise and then you get sirens you know and rifle fire it you know so you got that you would try and think of a thing where how to do what on the guitar without it sounding like uh you know uh uh you know somebody had put on a you know an effect on it or something and I and we always thought of this better two feet you know because you were thinking about what you were doing you try to do what what's there off the record fit because I think you know the did we we got a little we're lucky in the form that we got little you know um breaks and stuff that you can sort of play and it's just years of playing that you've built up things you know between you and an audience you know you get and I suppose in in from the early days picking up things you know you would watch Chuck I when I watch something like Chuck Berry or something you know we would always uh you know especially if he was uh singing you know he always had little rants that he had gone with an audience you know you go he'd go oley and the audience go oley You know and you go oley and they go oley you know and he had all of that you know he'd just go like this and the audience would respond so I would try and do I thought well with Chuck and him they're gonna do with the guitar so I go you know and if the Audince go yeah and you sort of build it up so you get like well Malcolm and myself it was you know we we would you know you I got it mainly from watching him you know and he was always sort of and um and if you hear a track like and one of the new ones Stiff-upper-lip you got a when I was a kid I would sit and I thought it was oh so clever yourself well you know I could that I could sit and knock these little things together and you were thinking it was you know it's a good exercise for you and you could sort of practice away with them and then I you know and even in the track thunderstruck when it was the same thing it'd come up like a it started like a one-handed so it started that way you know when you you know you'd end up you you used to have a funny thing it used to seem after six o'clock at night when the Sun went down or whatever time the Sun would go down there's when suddenly doesn't you know it's a bit vampire in a way and it is the sound would stop before you know it start to fall into place you know what sounded like uh you know uh you know a shambled in the morning sounded like something very together at night well if you look it's it's got a kind of devil see little horns a red devil yeah and uh it if you would you would see on a lot of uh I suppose people who collect guitars you know they would sort of go uh you know uh the one of the big collector items for a lot of years was that the voice Paul Gibson's you know with the the single cutaway and uh this was all solid and a bit of a very heavy guitar and if you're a little guy like me you know they they they can give you a hip displacement you know and uh so I always thought the SG was a lighter guitar because you could just pick it up like this and uh you know you didn't really have to sort of sit and like with this big heavy heavy thing strapped around you you know you know and um if you weren't a hunchback you would end up well you know somebody once said that they you know they said Angus it’s good I’ve been just you know in SG shop you know with one colour you know and and they’re all red yeah you know I think now I've got I've got hundreds own you know and bit different you know some custom some with you know like three pick up some with two some like this just to knock about I suppose we're at a guitar probably shines the best is usually if you're in a a studio you can you know you can get all your guitars and you can play them off and in the bank was as Malcolm myself you know we you know we always we’d compare to match up you know and he always is pretty much he's got his old Gretsch guitar and uh you know you would put the two together and it's just a case of just seen when it when it was the right now yeah well I've there’s a there's up there but I think it's four or 100 what lead super lead amps and they're they I think that th these reissue ones they they reissued and uh they tried to copy their u their older models so I'm using them at the moment and uh and I've got a little an older one a 50 watt that’s around the I think uh I think it's around this early 60s and uh in it's set up and they they put you know they mainly use that for the out front sound we just got used to you know with the amps it's making sure that people people would hear the guitar uh because it was obvious that we were a guitar based band and we didn't want to sound like a you know you know a strumming and a electrified folk group or something so that's mainly why we had all the big amps up there when I was younger we would you know you'd fiddle about with with stuff but um I used to always find that you know is a bit of you’d you've got to play some and the battery run out you gotta hit a while pedaling oh hey look no wow you know so you they didn't last long you know and then after a while I used to see how they they just Kloppers up your feet you know it was too much thinking you know what I mean and I thought well you know you know you just put you're playing in a rock'n'roll band you know in and it was kinda what was good about it was you know um you know because a lot of people were using them and at that time you know there's a lot of trends come and people go well you know the flavor of the day is this new pedal in that pedal and and if you see them now it looks like a space station on that you see guys got all these racks of gadgets and stuff you know and I we used to think that you know was just one more thing to make more more racket that didn't sort of enter into the music side of it so we just said uh scrap that instead we resorted and again to an effect or something you know you could just sit and you know try and get the best tone out of the guitar and uh you know bit with his natural distortion as possible I suppose these days it's sort of lifted guitars back into the game you know because for a long time guitars were sort of like okay well you know they put him in a mix and pull it all back and then there was just the left it was a solo or something they would go okay we bring it up for the solo and then you knock it back so we in being a guitar band you know we wanted the guitars right up front so um so you've got to you know leach for us we thought well with you know they're gonna hear us
