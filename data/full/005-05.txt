well good morning to you and nice to borrow your audience I was persuaded to write it by my publisher Michael Quarter at Simon and Schuster he said Chuck you gotta do a new book I said I just finished one I'm uh I gotta do I'm gonna do a movie now he said I even got a title for you and he gave me the title to be a man letters I said I can't resist the title it's and it's I had to split it up cuz at the time well Jack still is only five and a half he can read pretty well now but I said I can't write letters to him yet he said I said I'll write part of the chap- each chapter to the general audience that will read it and the end of each chapter to Jack and that worked out it's like acting I just like doing it again it's uh I love being a father to my two children when they were young they're both grown now have their own children of course and the chance to do it again uh with their children is irresistible I uh sons may now oppose but I think I was a good father and I think I'm a good grandfather I certainly enjoyed both roles I suppose it depends on the relationship they have with their parents we had a good relationship no they seem uh uh my son and his wife and Jack live only one Canyon away from us so that's geographically convenient and uh it's we’re delighted when circumstances work out so we can I can go pick up Jack at school and we can play tennis or I can take him to his karate lesson and my wife works on phonics with him for reading and all that stuff it's we have a great time that's an interesting question I think life in general is tougher the American experience is a harsher one I think uh if you want to put it that way the fabric and the view of many people many Americans the social fabric is fraying at the edges the idea of one nation um seems to have split up into un claws of different constituencies divided by race gender religion uh all these things and I don’t think it’s good no I don't think so just a while ago I was at a party and I fell into a conversation with a beautiful and uh very well-known actress whom I will not embarrass by naming and we were talking about this idea of one nation and she said well what about what it says on on the dollar bill a pluribus unum from one many and I said actually that translates from the Latin just the other way it's from many one she said no kidding well whatever well political correctness was invented by George Orwell in 1984 this book 1984 and it was meant it was a satire now it's coming into real life we there are things that you can't say you know you're supposed to you can't say American or American Indian you have to say Native American no I'm a Native American Jack threw on his grandmother's side is a 1/12 grand American and it's it's all these things are ridiculous and they will disappear in due time but it's too bad well I think the media to a certain extent is demonized the NRA but in the country they are generally regarded as and as they have been for a hundred and twenty six years as a positive force yeah as this strong defender of the Second Amendment which is a part of the Bill of Rights which is a unique document in the world no other country has a bill of rights and its sole purpose is to defend the individual American citizen from federal mandates interference I think there are certainly people who believe that and I think it was important to make certain that individuals who even suggested belonging to the radical fringe be eliminated call people whose attention to the Bill of Rights the First Amendment Second Amendment all of them are of equal importance and utterly unique yes uh and they'll seed too uh I suppose three of them you would call were all huge physical pictures yeah sure it's valuable to do it really is but uh those are the sort of pictures that can't be made anymore oh cost a good example uh my son as a director made a picture last year year before um with no names in it um and some kids and um it cost 23 million dollars now that's more than twice what Ben Hur cost and Ben Hur when at this when it was made it was 14 million seven most expensive movie ever made they could never do those films now but yes but to do Ben Hur now I'm not saying it wasn't a successful picture I'm saying you couldn't remake it if they could have they would by now I could play the Jack Hawkins part it was a pretty good part and but to to make Ben Hur now made originally for 14 7 would cost 212 million dollars they said now you can't do that Fox is very sorry they spent that much on Titanic actually once I'd learned to drive the chariot it was kind of fun I took my little son and riding around the lap or two and my wife rode in it and it's besides I knew I was going to win that helps no that well i didn't all this the actor who tells me he does his own stunts was either an idiot or a liar there are another shots you can do I’m a modestly competent horseman and if we're now across the chariot is a different thing it's not riding that's driving and the stunt coordinator or the second union director are always the people who know everything that need to be known about it and I always say can I do this shot and they'll say yeah shouldn't do this one chuck I said okay and if they say yeah you can do this then i do it it's very simple no I I still have the moses staff no I've been asked to look at at least five chariots that people paid a lot of money for none of them is yet the chariot that I drove
