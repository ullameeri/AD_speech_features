Ballroom um I can’t remember the name of it now but yeah yeah I that that guitar playing was a heck lot easier than picking up at hole handle man or plough and er looking at the North End of the South Pole mule eh yeah playing a guitar was a lot more fun yeah a friend named Jerry Nailor and I set in um um at a session I tell you we were doing a recordings I was in there with somebody and I just sat

because it was you know oh yeah any anything that gets job oh it’s great Cal was playing drums ff- before he could stand up yeah eh eh eh Kim would put him em em tin played out there in spoon and he’d go ding he he and he’d see I’m looking smile at you know he’d go ding ding ding and and and I’d add like a different sound to him and he’d go ding ding ding dong ding and he I’d say he started playing

went home for couple of weeks just see mum and dad and all the kids and and do that and then heck I was ready to go back to California I could I could not wait to get in a studio and um I got this I got some pump for that well a long time with Jimmy Webb that’s a thrill I’m telling you that’s me playing guitar there on that rhythm it was um the Viva Las Vegas um movie yeah rhythm you know and and

just lollygagging you know Jimmy Bowin was producing that day and um he said um he said were you looking at Frank a lot and I said yeah cause I said I do what was coming out of him next and you know after the first chorus and um he said yeah he yeah he thought I had he thought of it to and he says he told me that Sinatra said who is the homosexual guy he had in there and I went what do you mean eh yeah he probably had another one I don’t know I’m loving it was that was the most fun of of I think of my em em guitar career it was doing the sessions yeah it was a lot of fun yeah that was fun I took Brian’s place that means you have to sing the high part and play base and that was eh eh eh patting yourself cause I’m not a base player oh yeah yeah uh uh I’ve known them I played on the I did a record session yeah and uh he he call me up and said I didn’t know you can sing I said sing and I said you never told me it was just amazing he said come in on audition and I got the Summer Smothers

John Wayne and uh yeah I signed her autographs and and she hugged my neck she was just the fan of the Goodtime Hour no he says uh when when they started True Grit that was a good while after that True Grit was um and he he just said want Glen in the movie and I’d never acted before well yeah I it wasn’t I I didn’t want to but you know I wanted to but I knew I couldn’t act because I’d never had any training when I mean I really kinda got to know John Wayne he was he said I’m glad you could do the movie kid you know and that just wow it was just magnificent oh yeah if he told you a hog weighed five pound wrap it up cause it was there man he there was over the ears about mister Tom Wayne boy um everybody knows what’s you’re doing you know they got your nose and eh eh oh yeah but you know I guess I think m- we probably deserve it sometime no I was I I gotten on alcohol and um cocaine that I had I got off the cocaine um pretty early though I quit it for one reason I started waking up and I didn’t know where I was and I said it’s time you gotta quit this bang bang bang I was just real jerk I think and I think the alcohol and the drugs they’ll do that to you you know it’ll it’ll come out but um my wife Kim Kim put up with me she shammed through it all with me and I went to um um the rehab centre Kim saved my life actually I think um cause for what I I and I said you wanna um get married and raise some kids and you know let’s see if I can do something the right way you know that was what I was thinking and um I had met her in New York City and um she was this she was a heck of a girl she is a heck of a girl and um well you wanna go to Phoenix she said where’s Phoenix and I said it’s in Arizona and um that was it we got married and got three kids and I told everybody that I can beat it that I was sorry for being such a jerk big times yeah well Larry Weiss wrote that that’s ah what a great song just blew me away uh gal who could sing a good harmony uh lo- lo- lot of people sing relative harmony and um that won’t work if you’re singing um you know cause you you’re not making all the curly cures that that harmony is doing but uh well like uh sh- Sher had a monotone harmony type of thing that she had sing to play to sing with her and you know she’s one of the best singers in I mean in mercy uh yeah I did Rick’s stuff and uh I did a I did a lot of ‘em with him you know like to singing with Dean Martin eh eh it was great man it was yeah I sang I’d I’d practice singing just the harmony just for the heck of it you know because there wasn’t a lot to do on the farm this kid I’ll tell you his name after the stories eight years old and I was in um Australia and um he’d come up for mister Campbell he said when I grow up I’m gonna I’m gonna sing and play guitar just and it was just like you and I said well you won’t play better than that you know and he said what eh eh I said I’m just kidding and he’s like oh yeah he got it you know he said I wanna play that guitar just like you and it’s he’s name is Keith Urban eh eh there he is eight year old kid and I saw him in front of it here for a back he was eight years old and he was down at this concert he said he liked my records and I said well thanks you know it made me feel good eh eh yeah I’ve been very blessed boy um um no I did um dad bought a guitar when well first it was a mandolin and I started playing that’s why I played mandolin and it’s um oh I I would play them if you know if they’re if if they’re playable but they they you know um you have to have the shave everything down so just to you know or it’s or the the um um I’d be I’ve been playing amazing range and then go uh Julian uh the guy that naturally produced all this for us from capital um it was just so easy to do well you know he he he’d just hand me the songs hand me probably a hundred and ten songs and he said um see if there’s any you like on here you know but I had heard some of those songs what were the hits back then and um if the song is a hit once it’s a hit again for the next generation if if it’s done right and um I actually was I I I wanted to do that because I really liked that material yeah I like the studio I like the studio um I’m I’m so pleased with the way the album turned out uh it’s it I I like it I really like it and I’m and I’m flattered that other people are liking the album you know and um it’s it’s good music it’s good lyrics it’s good um it’s good poetry I I don’t know I really never thought of it they what’s conception eh eh eh the what you see and what I say and how I am and um I I learned a long time ago no no bs and no lying and no cheating because God told us not to do those things and um I mean I I I drowned when I was um only a year and a half old and every once in a while that will come back over me uh uh yeah I will the the dark darkness and stuff and I think I actually and when I was up the next morning I was singing to the old battery radio we had and um I’ve
