well they're compatible except in the sense that one has a limited amount of time and that was potentially a very full-time jobs um yes they're compatible or in fact uh to some extent they possibly help each other no I don't think so I think as a novelist one is just the uh the pupil of great novelists of the past in in in a quite straightforward way I don't think big a philosopher um alters or certainly doesn't help once a job as a as an artist when writing a novel um I suppose by my interests in philosophy are chiefly in moral philosophy and in political philosophy and possibly to some extent uh thinking about situations in moral philosophy or thinking about uh problems of freedom and problems of moral decision and so on this may affect uh sometimes the way one portrays a character well the philosophy is very different stuff from a fictional writing philosophy is very different job uh one’s aiming at different result one’s not aiming at beauty and work of art which are quite special kind of thing on the aiming at producing Urschel but the subject matter is the same that is human nature operating well that was rather exceptional uh the introduction of an actual piece of philosophy into novel I think is a very dangerous thing to do I think that uh certain French writers attempted sometimes they get away with it sometimes not I think it's very dangerous uh to produce pieces of theorizing which could actually be lifted out as it were because they will tend to stick out of one's uh cloth and attract attention to themselves yes I mean this is something I I don't feel altogether I care about myself I I think that's well I think there's very very little great art and one reason for this is that both the artist and of course the the consumer too um as it were seek to readily to be consoled that some kind of of pleasing a consoling pétomane sentimentality would be one aspect of this because which then prevents one from producing something which has got uh the kind of hardness and truthfulness which great art has got yes yes and I think even even even things which are good which aren't obviously uh uh bogus or cheap or grossly sentimental can tend to fail in this particular way because there's some sort of easy pattern which emerges which the writer then follows well in a way I don't know that one can have undue attention for values I think form is frightfully important in in art but it it uh it well in a novel of course it can I suppose possibly conflict with rarely free development a character that one uh finds a sort of tension between producing uh a very satisfactory pattern and letting some character have his way or let rip as it were well um the the main contrast I suppose is between Randall and Ann I mean Ann is the unofficial Rose she's the the formless object I mean this contrast between will represents in a rather different way the same contrast that Hugo and Jake present they conflict between Hugo and Jake is the uh I mean this is pretty key to the kind of pompous way but there is a conflict between the the man who is an artist and who wants form and who has to run the risks of saying things and using words and so on and the man who is potentially um well potentially the saint or some potentially the good man uh who renounces uh uh well who renounces speech in a way I mean this is something that's always seemed to me paradoxical that that um well that speech itself uh can in some way be immediately misleading or immediately consoling I mean there's some I mean it's kind of mad where I want to say that the really good person doesn't say anything uh well anyway at the end Randall Ann situation the contrast is a slightly different one but perhaps similar well I wouldn't I wouldn't want to imply that I mean the the book may suggest that because of the sort of ineffectual nurse attaching to Ann’s relation with Felix and so on and the inconclusiveness but what I was more thinking of was the way in which perhaps the um the good person doesn't have a picture of himself I mean this was something that I wanted to say about Hugo that Hugo didn't recognize himself when he's presented by Jake in this picture I mean Jake is worried in case Hugo says you caricatured me in fact Hugo doesn’t recognize himself at all when now Ann again has no image of herself she is unable to reflect on herself whereas Randall who is as it were the artist he represents the the the man who poses form upon himself and upon the world and wants form and who loves form in in the Roses and so on um I don't know that I've gotten a very clear theory about Miranda’s dolls now they represent a a particular uh sort of aspect of her childhood and protecting herself from the world with various images and so on and then uh the destruction of them somehow represents her growing up or her emerging from this state yes one might say this yes but one's afraid to put too much theoretical wasted away well um again nothing very clear I don't think I mean it is it is a work of art under two gathers round itself the sort of passions which a a great work of art which is also valuable object tends to generate uh its its loved and at the same time it's it's just an object of value which can be bothered well yes Hugh of course um is is in uh as it were setting Randall free doing something for himself retrospectively that is he wishes that he in the past perhaps had acted in what he conceives of as a more free way and he wants to give Randall as it were symbolically for himself this same opportunity well it just um fell out so is it well I mean it what one of the subjects of the book is uh Hugh's uh new life as it were after his wife's death and his reliving of things earlier in his life uh his rediscovery of things so that in a way Fanny's death is just the convenient starting point for the entire new situation which affects everybody yes possibly I I think one can perhaps go too far in finding patterns amid the cat you know the cat just arrived there was the cat I thought I'd have a cat and then what does the cat do this this happened really more or less accidentally and and in fact it fitted quite happily into the general pattern well yes I'm not sure but demonic um in a way the what I would like to do is to portray non-demonic love uh I mean we all know about demonic love it's it's the the other kind which is much more difficult to portray and this um I mean I don't think it's a particularly successful novel and I mean Ann is not I think a particularly successful character but I was trying in Ann to portray somebody loving in a kind of blank way where there's new romance this new demonism there’s no uh none of the kind of stormy forces which make love interesting in uh usually in fiction and in life uh and then this Swan one who was a makes these sort of a rather um soppy remarks um interpreting ends uh love in a way would she herself tends to reject um and this is important that she rejects it yes yes I mean they help it atmospherically yes um I don't think so no I mean there the book portrays different kinds of people loving in different kinds of ways um but the main the sort of structural contrast is the contrast between between Ann and Randall well he's an obvious counterpart to Miranda um in some general way he represents the the good child as it were and and uh it's significant that um uh Emma um leaves her money to pay and I mean that he he is as it were the successor or the person to whom um one thinks of going all as as it were in the future to Warns um um innocent person and somebody coming from um um well from a more democratic society and so on I mean there's a faint um criticism of the snobbery as it where of the um English set up applied in Pence well this is just another another case of being in love I mean again and innocent I mean again a kind of innocent love well it has that important well this this isn't really a very important theme uhI mean I thought I'll I’ll make this boy come from somewhere far away and I thought of putting in the Australian background well again this is purely accidental I wanted her to be rich and I thought this was a good way for her to make her money well I don't suggest any very weighting significance I mean it it's it's just to show that Randall can be loved in a straightforward uh um moderately selfless way well love does always tend to do that but I don't think I was particularly pursuing that well this would be intended yes in fact it's very difficult to portray that sort of character without uh some kind of loss of energy or something which may make the character uninteresting but she was certainly intended to be thought of as a as a good person and as having this glorious sort of unselfawareness this lack of self lack of ego as it were is one kind of way of being good yes and she doesn't recognize anything for herself in the second yes yes yes yes he makes a number of theoretical remarks some of which I would endorse but not all of all well then this must be the last point we take up I don't remember that the EM Forster once said that the relationship of an author to his character as the novel is a relationship of love and this is relationship so important in your novels do you feel it to be analogous to your own relationship to the fiction that you're making well I think I think there is an analogy between loving somebody in real life in such a way that you can rarely will them to be independent of you or leave them free and uh loving one’s characters I I do love my characters and this the difficulty is the same difficulty that one must be able to leave them free to make them independent this is not easy
