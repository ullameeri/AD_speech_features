well I noted the President Eisenhower issued a statement from Gettysburg yesterday in which he said that uh I was the best informed vice president that the country had ever had and so the question is the credibility of Lyndon Johnson or the credibility of Dwight Eisenhower I think the great majority of the American people Democrats and Republicans alike would say that the Eisenhower credibility is infinitely higher than Lyndon Johnson's credibility the meat of the president's criticism is that he did not answer the questions uh I asked some questions some questions that were very important to uh the lives of American fighting men in Vietnam uh as to whether we were going to have an increase in the number of forces to 500,000 600,000 or 700,000 as some administration sources have indicated or whether we were going to do what the Republicans have recommended that is to increase our air and sea stripe strikes against North Vietnam uh he declined to answer these questions and then he engaged in what I thought was a rather uh well uh a personal attack uh which is not worthy of the President of the United States now let me say this uh this attack isn't going to gag me uh as you may remember Bill uh I was never one that could be arm twisted by anyone and frightened even by the towering temper of Lyndon Johnson uh he has a perfect right to call me a chronic campaigner uh but I would just point this out for the record I don't think any American and I would say no Democrat has defended our policy in Vietnam more effectively than I have in every capital of the world I've defended it in Paris I've defended it in London I defended it in Rome I defended it in all the capitals of Europe I defended it all over Asia I defended our policy all over the United States and while President Johnson was in Manila I did not criticize I did not even comment about Vietnam and I defended our policy against the attacks that Bobby Kennedy made on premier key at that time uh now he can call that uh chronic campaigning uh I would simply suggest that the voters the American people are fair-minded and I think as they look at the president maybe they will think that he was a tired man uh and perhaps was engaging in some uh ra- verbal abuse which uh after he thinks about me would wish that he hadn't done Bob our policy should not be an issue if you're talking about policy and terms of the great goal of no reward for aggression here the Republicans give the Johnson administration the support that his own party denies him and let the record show he's the first president in history who has been unable to unite his own party behind a war never happened before but insofar as the means to achieve that goal uh how do we get this war over with uh rather than letting it drag on for five years which this president ministrations policy would let it do uh on that particular point that is a legitimate subject for debate and that was what my question is directed to well if the President of the United States uh attacks me uh one who has supported his policy and supported it around the world one who has answered critics uh stood up against hostile pickets all the way from Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia uh to the college campuses of the United States uh then certainly that's going to frighten others who have more to risk than I have uh uh I think President Johnson and I have great respect for him for his political ability uh I've known him as you gentlemen have during the years we've known in Washington uh but on the other hand I think President Johnson uh tends uh to have an attitude that unless everybody goes all the way with LBJ then it's none of the way uh he isn't going to get away with that with me and he shouldn't get away with that with his own party uh I believe that you need to have dissent and I would say that a policy that condemns American boys to fighting the kind of a war that is in the interests of the Communists a ground war a one that is going to cost us more casualties than in Korea I say that that kind of a policy needs discussion it needs criticism and President Johnson ought to listen you ought to listen and answer questions rather than to indulge in that rather kind of cheap political demagoguery that he we saw a moment ago the difficulty with mr. Johnson's position is that he uh he rejects the whole concept of bipartisanship uh you recall Bill when we first met twenty years ago the Vandenberg uh Truman bipartisanship where Vanderberg together with Harry Truman and Dean Acheson and others created the great ideas that greek uh turkish program and then later on of course that led to uh the grand alliance the Marshall Plan now how did this come about it came about by reasonable men disagreeing and disagreeing very strongly about means but agreeing on the goals we're talking about means here and as far as the commitment manila communique is concerned what happened here is that what there was a that we are reaping the consequences of instant diplomacy a trip that was hastily planned uh Foster Dulles used to say you should never go to the summit you heard him say this unless you have it well prepared in advance and Lyndon Johnson planned this trip he rushed out to Manila uh they get out of communique it served a useful purpose and getting our allies together uh and in reassuring them and I was glad that the president representing the American people received such a wonderful reception all over Asia but let the record show that as far as the communique is concerned it is a booby trap on if the Communists should accept it because what it says is that in the event that they withdraw their forces from South Vietnam and and I quote the violence subsides we will withdraw our forces within six months 10,000 miles away that means that all that we fought for could be lost because then the Vietcong who would continue to be supported logistically by the North Vietnamese would have the upper hand over the South Vietnamese we just simply can't leave that kind of an offer outstanding uh this is a diplomatic booby trap and President Johnson should withdraw this particular offer if it is an offered or clarify it at the earliest possible time that's what I suggest they do now this is this is not carping criticism this is in the interest of saving American lives it's in the interest of seeing to it that the that the Americans who have died and we've had 35,000 casualties in Vietnam uh 6,000 dead and the rest limited Michigan but they don't die in vain and I'm going to speak up I don't care what Lyndon Johnson says we're looking at the secretary McNamara statement uh what concerned me is the way that statement was interpreted and the way it was headlined around the country I had here the headline from the morning uh paper here in uh in New York let me show it for the television camera my mayor that one over there Ike has if this says LBJ election Eve move cutback in Viet comma and draft now what does that mean to the average reader uh the average reader who doesn't read the fine within the policy or the fine print in a McNamara communicate what it means is that the American people millions of Americans who have their sons in vietnam or whose sons may go there or their loved ones will think that we're going to cut back on our forces in Vietnam what the McNamara announcement really means is this at the present time we have three hundred and forty thousand troops in Vietnam this year we had an increase of two hundred thousand in Vietnam all he said there was that we wouldn't increase next year by as much as we did this year and I interpret that to mean that there will be over five hundred thousand American troops in Vietnam next year and he ought to say that uh he ought to say that now and I would also say this uh I respect secretary McNamara along with secretary Rusk as the two ablest members of the president's cap I have not been among those Republicans who uh criticized the either of women of call for McNamara's resignation but let me say this that I think that Lyndon Johnson uh by bringing secretary McNamara down to the ranch uh and then using him as a political problem that he has impaired the integrity of the office of Secretary of Defense I think that uh Jim Forrestal secretary Forrestal but turn over in his grave if he thought that this office which is supposed to be above politics would be used for this kind of political uh fakery and that's what it is well in view of the McNamara record on his predictions and its Adelie in his own press conference uh he had a Freudian slip slip I think when he said that his predictions had not proved too good on this in uh in Vietnam uh mr. McNamara is the singing man again in a political context who two years ago said and I quote uh that virtually all of the American military personnel would be out Vietnam within 16 months and so when he says that draft calls are going to be down over the next four months I don't think the American people can believe that any more that they can believe his track record I think doesn't very much let me say that secretary McNamara when it comes to running the defence department is an efficient secretary of defence but when he takes off his hat as Secretary of Defense and becomes Lyndon Johnson's Charlie McCarthy his political student uh in order to make a political announcement uh then secretary McNamara I think loses much of his credibility and I and I hope that tomorrow uh before the people vote he himself will clear this up and say yes uh the headlines across the country are long I did not mean that we were going to decrease the number of American men I do not mean that the decreasing the draft means were going to have less men in Vietnam that actually we're going to increase the number of men to over 500,000 that is this administration's answer in Vietnam Bob let me correct you I understand I I I called for that in August in August we had 300,000 in Vietnam and I called for a 25% increase which would raise it to 400,000 that's right that's right but you understand that time we had 300 we're up to 400,000 and then later I have made it clear that I believe that now that we've come to 400,000 and I made that suggestion because I feel that's where we should be we should not now continue to go the road of more ground forces you see this administration is talking not only about 500,000 but some administration sources have talked about 600,000 uh one Pentagon source three months ago indicated three-quarters of a million that's the wrong road 400,000 is as much as we should have there but we now need to do is to use more air and sea power against more targets in North Vietnam and in this McNamara press conference he dodged that question he said that was a military security matter well of course this parts that we hit will be a military security matter but the Republicans have made it clear and the issue is clear if you want to fight this war on the ground if you want to increase our forces from the 400,000 that I have recommended in which we will reach by the end of this year uh to 500,000 the secretary McNamara indicates that's one way that's their way but if on the other hand the American people say no we're going to use our strength our air and sea power against more targets in North Vietnam they should elect more republicans for the House and Senate Bill I would never have called for such a powwow uh as you call it uh except for the fact that at the present time uh we had the most servile Congress uh that we've had in history this incidentally is not my interpretation uh a Larry O'Brien in a move that I am sure he thought was going to to help uh uh the president took time off from delaying the mails the other date an issue a political announcement uh in and he said that this administrate that this Congress had a record the highest percentage of voting all the way with the President of any Congress in history 90 percent he thought that was good but what I'm suggesting is this all the wisdom is in the Lyndon Johnson all the wisdom wisdom isn't in the Republican Party all the wisdom isn't in the Democratic Party what I do know is that our present policy can lead us to disaster because if we're in Vietnam Bill five years from now as we said I think in this program before with you at that time we run the risk of a confrontation with a communist China that would have nuclear weapons they can deliver we must avoid this the way to avoid it is to do what General Eisenhower has recommended and that is to use maximum military power against North Vietnam to shorten the war and to bring them to the conference table this is the difference now the purpose of this powwow is to get that kind of new thinking into the consciousness the president of United States and I believe that if he sits down with Republicans and Democrats maybe we'll get a new policy Bob I think you have to read the Eisenhower proposal in the context of the report Republican coordinating councils uh recommendation in December of this year and as you know he is a member of that Council and he was present at this meeting and that council recommended uh that we should put more emphasis on air and sea power which is where we are strong uh rather than more emphasis on ground power what I am suggesting here is this I'm not suggesting an absolute ceiling of 400,000 we have to do what is necessary but I am suggesting that the administration relies almost exclusively on more and more manpower that's their kind of a war and they'll beat us right whereas the Republicans say let's hit more military targets in North Vietnam that will shorten the war and that's what President Eisenhower has been talking about more military targets in North Vietnam more air power more sea power let's hope it's over by this time Bill I'll stick with the figures that we talked about when I was last on this program with you alone uh I believe we're going to have the biggest Republican gained across the country in any off year election since 1946 and uh in numbers I I stick with the figures of uh a net gain of 40 in the house and that of three in the Senate six uh governors and the 700 state legislators now I could be off a few uh but I think it's going to be a net magnitude no it could be but we'll take the house uh the house is going to be very close and when you're on election eve uh you're going to have great difficulty in saying what the house is going to be because the count always comes last for the house as you know they count the governors and Senators first uh and I believe they're going to be at least 15 or 16 very very close races I think in the house we could win as many as 48 I think we could win as few as 32 but uh there are about 18 or 16 swing districts it could go either way I have a feeling that it'll be 40 and I think the swing is more likely to be our way than their way but this is where I could be wrong no Bill uh I know that uh my good friend Everett Dirksen and he's his truth observer who's talked as you know in terms of 55 or 60 which would almost win the house uh but the win the house would take a landslide of major proportions I do not see that I do see the best gainsns however ever made uh in a president's first term after his election in in 30 years let me point this out it there's been a lot of a numbers game going on here about what is a win and Lyndon Johnson says well 60 is uh the average uh if you look at the presidents who win landslides you know uh the when you have those shifts and somebody else is said 40 actually it's 10 because they're the only way you can make this comparison I think uh fairly is to take each president when he is most popular and that's right after he's first elected in his own right Roosevelt in 3401 uh gain gain nein Harry Truman in 1450 after his election in 48 lost 29 Eisenhower and 54 after his election in 52 lost 18 and and Jack Kennedy in Jack Kennedy in 19 uh uh 64 lost 62 lost only four that's an average of 10 Lyndon Johnson will lose three times the average and he'll lose more than either Roosevelt Truman for Eisenhower or Kennedy which will make this the greatest repudiation of a president in his first term after this election in the last 30 years uh Bob we're going to have an embarrassment of riches uh it's really great to have uh not only these men that you mentioned but others uh of national structure I would add uh to the presidential vice presidential list some of the new stars among the new governors around the country uh certainly governor Rhodes who will probably be the biggest winner uh will be a strong contender you can't rule out men like Volpe in Massachusetts who will win in a heavily Democratic State uh and uh you've got all I think will look across the country and see what's going to happen uh when Jerry Ford and Mel Laird will have a stronger number of Republicans behind me I think we're going to have a great number of Republican candidates for president vice president in 1968 you're absolutely right I uh as a matter of fact uh the elections of 1966 uh will be a benefit to the winners and and the winners are those who run you know somebody has asked me uh whether or not uh I'm going to get credit if we gain 30 seats or 40 seats and uh general Rom you know whom both of you know used to say to me uh he said you know uh defeat is an orphan and victory has many fathers all the winners there'll be plenty of fathers and if we lose I'll get blamed Bill uh that question is not unexpected and I am sure you expect an answer but uh let me be quite candid after these arduous attorneys and they have been arduous with a small staff I don't have a delegate I don't have a commitment uh I don't have a strap I have two secretaries and one research man I don't have any money I earn enough but I have no private fortune I have no base I have no office uh and after this election and this will be an announcement that I'm going to make right now I'm going to take a holiday from politics for at least six months with no political speeches scheduled whatever uh what the future holds I don't know uh I actually meant what I said when I started this campaign I want to get this party or help to get it unified and get it back on its feet uh then the future will take care of itself that future may have a part for me in it uh the probabilities are that it will not because his Bob pointed out the big winners are those who actually run uh but I will be satisfied believe me if if the Republican Party is back in business because if we win as big as I think we're going to win across this country we can elect our candidate in 1960 1968
