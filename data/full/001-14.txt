there’s very few rock and roll bands there’s rock bands there’s sort of metal there’s whatever but there’s no rock and roll bands there’s there’s Stones and us and the their sound is completely different to us so we really aim getting known in the area that’s going back in time and put the sounds the what the old analogue sounds you know so we try to even keep that and and the sounds are bigger than digital well rock bands rock bands don’t really swing rock and roll has the swing you know like you’ve got your high hats you know and other rock’s not got that swing in the high hats becomes stiff they don’t understand the feel the movement you know the jungle of it all it’s a feeling they need to entertain as well as good music in a live situation otherwise people can see it once and next time they’re well we saw it we’ve got the record who cares you know but the AC/DC some concerts can be because of the what Angus does on the show on that night or brine you know it’s just that performance and they come in and well something’s gonna happen on that stage tonight they always know that and that’s what I think it is the personality of the two upfront as well as a really good band and good writing and determined never to change what we do it’s just to never change it it’s what we always wanted to do so you don’t go do something you’ve always wanted to do and 25 years later you say it’s time for a change yeah but we’ve always tried to get that dim of light you know filled in style because that’s what the style of the band was you know it’s a simple simple listen to drumming  and that’s what we aim for would have been that swing they need to swing a bit you know that was so that's what is required but we always had the ambition to get Phil back you know it was just the matter of time for Phil he just needed a time out thing you know to get get back to his his own life an everything but he said he wanted back you know and he was just waiting for the moment and so we were just putting drummers in there really until we got him back because he he is much he is the real sound with the rest of the guys it’s the real deal you know and it still sounded like the AC/DC but it just didn’t have as much umf under it now I called Bon's parents to let them know what had happened they used to say wake up your daughters when we came around now they say wake up your mothers Bon was becoming a hero very quickly amongst the tougher guys in the audience they all wanted Bon the drink and the wild life you know it was just like learning to read you know it was part of you know it was the norm we thought everyone was like that our family just arrived in Australia penniless and six months later you got TV cameras outside the doors you got a famous brother and a famous band we told our parents we are doing the same band they were oh I’ll give this a week to survive cause we fought all the time well there was sawing machine that had AD/DC on the back of it and we will toss around names for weeks and she just said it one night and everyone went that’s that’s good ay you know what that means don’t you you guys aren’t all gay I said what you looking for trouble pal you know he said no no seriously bisexual it’s AC/DC and I was oh fuck we better change the name she just said to Angus you know Angus you still look like a schoolboy you know and go wear a schoolboy uniform I thought she said it jokingly but next thing she was stitching up school suits for him you know he’d go on with his make-up and he maybe even blow ‘em kisses you know we just grew grew not to like him when we met him for the first time it feels like we’ve known him forever no fucking with Bon no fucking with us guys he almost become a brother we just said do you wanna join without even fining with a gun that’s how confident we were that he was gonna work with it two weeks later we show up and go George we got a new singer and he go what George was like deja man no doubt he says let’s reshape the whole thing you’re a real rock’n ’roll band now and we we heard his voice properly and this head guy’s got some voice he can scream got great melody a great feel we were living in this house for three months still the best days of our lives was more action going on there than ever since we drank like there was no tomorrow we woke up and drank again and we just continued on like that for a long time hey fritz with that title they didn't like that title  and we go back to the hotel we say oh Bon you know it's three in the morning you know we gotta go we gotta crash nah just one more drink and we'd wake up in the morning bon wake up oh oh oh and he'd getting up back on his drink oh where are we we were fantastic you know and he's waking up and his teeth were all fixed and we said you know we're just about ready for you Bon and I said maybe next week some time and of course it never happened you know he went out just for a drink a relaxation you know maybe to clear the head you know and then look forward to getting into his writing come up with some ideas you know he had it all in front of him he choke through the through the night you know Angus called me and I just thought we'd stand you can't explain this and how it affects you you know everything just is is numb it's as simple as that someone had to tell them you know and it better coming from one of the band than from the newspaper most difficult thing I've ever have to do God knows how they felt I hope I never have to do anything like that again especially in Britain they made it a bit of a joke almost you know we've never forgiven 'em for that all we were concerned about mainly at that time were Bon's parents they are really nice people they don't need it but ay we'll never get out of that one you know we wanted to continue the band but we just didn’t have the will to at the time but you know we got their blessing so let's go and try to do something there will never be another Bon but Brian walked in one day for audition we just felt really comfortable with him and and he could sing his balls out Brian was very worried you know at the time and ah but we thought well you just hang in there Brian you just do what you do best those kids you know in the first gig we did those fans were there really good work Brian you know you know you know best wishes there was banners everywhere that first show I thought that was a joke at first and then I thought this is crazy I mean what what why are we connected anyway that song is not called night well it's called night prowler I mean it's about it's easiest to do when you're a kid like sneaking in like girlfriend's bedroom window when their parents are asleep it's been called everything since you know AD/DC the meaning of the letters you know no matter you tell them the sawing machine story and everything they still think no there's more to it as long as we got clubs to play well we cool you know if we could fly around the world in clubs hey we're alive so we were never you know felt defeated my drinking overtook you know my whole thing you know I felt like almost of the check almost died so I had a talk with Angus and I said how would you feel if if I could at least take a break so I was letting people down making people get worried about me I wasn't brain dead but I I was just physically and mentally screwed by the by the alcohol that did it that that got me right it emm it put me on track you know it woke your eyes up it was all back to normal like yea so that's about all I could say about that you know it was a detour a bad detour I had to take you know and I was hoping I never go on that one again there's no doubt about it it's the sound and the band is ah you know it's the combination of the guitars you know we can really challenge minds we just wanted to be a good rock 'n' roll band you know and that's it the simplicity of it and that's all we can do you know and stick to what you do best that's what we do best you know they say we keep doing the same stuff but rock 'n' roll has been around since 50s I mean we are rock 'n' roll there's a lot of pretenders out there I sit down to think about Bon some time and I just think in hindsight could we've stopped this from happening but I every time I think about things like this I end up with a smile my face at the end of it because it's almost like is a little tap here saying don't worry kid you're you're fine you know you're doing you've kept it going you're doing what I want we're feeling timeless you know and you know the trends come and go and we'll still be running through the trends and sometimes we may do really well sometimes maybe not so well but it won't never change and and there's no there's no way for us to go believe me
