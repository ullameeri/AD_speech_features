well I I was um I was born in Dublin and uh my uh parents are uh uh Protestant Irish uh and uh my father decided for uh reasons which I've never entirely been able to uh sort out though I can guess at I suppose that some of them decided to leave Ireland uh when I was one I was removed therefore to London where he went into the civil service so I grew up in uh London although I went to Ireland for holidays and I I feel extremely Irish and feel I feel very involved in Ireland and and in what's happening in our live now but I I grew up in London and um uh I went to a boarding school and then I went on to uh to to to Oxford I did greats yes that is is Greek and Latin classical languages and history and philosophy so I I got a big dose of philosophy there no you don’t oh well I'm afraid that the study of temporary or authors which I rather deplore actually have has begun in Oxford but not as far as creative writing goes no no l oh well now I'm afraid it's it's you know what was published last week but this is a very bad arrangement I think because it means that young people uh will always tend to want to read the modern books probably they find them easier and so on and uh they want to be up-to-date and so forth and to spend uh hours of study and a great university um reading the latest novel it seems to me a waste of time they ought to be reading things which are much more difficult but probably much more rewarding I mean the the literature of the past in Chaucer Spencer Shakespeare Milton and uh the rich 19th century novels because they will find these less accessible later on if they don't read them there and they may simply lose that part of their education altogether if they spend time with the moderns well I didn't really decide anything um uh because of the war and so on um I I knew very early on that I wanted to be writer I mean when I was child I I I knew that but um the war really disturbed all one's feelings of the future very profoundly ob- obviously um and when I I finished my undergraduate degree I was immediately um conscripted because everybody was and um I went into the civil service into the Treasury and um where I spent a couple of years and then I went into amra and worked with refugees in in different parts of Europe after the war United Nations relief and rehabilitation organization it still exists under a slightly similar name well it was um um um extraordinary I mean it it it I was working um first of all in in in Belgium at a sort of headquarters but I wanted to get out onto the Battlefront as it were and and I then was working in refugee camps in Austria where the scene was desolation I mean transport had broken down um food supplies had broken down people who had been um taken over by Hitler as forced labour uh were wandering about hoping to find somewhere to be and somewhere where they could be fed and and then ultimately of course somewhere to go to because a lot of these people didn't want to go back to their home countries which might have been Yugoslavia or Poland or Czechoslovakia or something they well a lot of them wanted to come here yeah yes it was bit later than yes yes well what happened was the McCarran act  yes well I was a member of the Communist party for short time uh when I was a student it around about 1939 uh but I left it uh I I I just as well in a way to have seen the inside of Marxism in a way because then when one realizes how strong it is and how awful it is I mean it is certainly in its organized form well I think to have read a lot of a lot of Marx I mean to have read the texts is is valuable I mean one it's part of our history and it's it said these were very very influential books um but the organization of the party was was as it were depressing I didn't like it and I soon got fed up with it uh however I mean this um had repercussions later on because I was awarded um in about nineteen I can't remember her example she I know it must have been up in 1947 by then yes a scholarship to come to FAFSA and I was longing to go to America I mean you know it was sort of such an adventure you see after being cooped up in England during the war uh one did want to travel and see the world I very much wanted to go to America but I was prevented by the McCarran act I was not given a visa which meant that I I had to spend a whole year in England sort of unemployed because there was a lot of I may say there wasn't much to do about this a Bertrand Russell got involved yes it was a sort of tiny little coarser labour actually Bertrand Russell and and justice Frankfurter were involved today trying to say how ridiculous this was but McCarran act is made of and it's still here and I still have to ask for waiver if I want to come to this country yes it’s it's lunatic and one of the questions which is sometimes asked one by some naive person some official is uh can you prove that you are no longer member of the Communist party I think it would be extremely difficult as I left it by fifty years ago well I I did spend a lot of time Paris yes but it was really a struggle luck this because it meant that I I have around four year during which time I read philosophy uh by myself really was some help from people in Oxford and then I went to Cambridge which was uh I got a scholarship at Cambridge as a postgraduate and uh Wittenstein was there he was just leaving unfortunately what I had to ascertain we have talked with him before he left and but Cambridge was simply crammed with with Wittenstein I mean his disciples were there and his friends were there and I I spent the year talking to them and that was a very profitable year indeed well I don't think they show up directly at all uh except occasionally I've had I've had a couple of characters who were philosophers but uh it's just that I mean if if one and sure this room is is full of novelists or people who are going to become novelists and the great thing is to to know something you know to know about something rather and uh any any skill or expertise that you have can help you in your novels I mean I would I very much wish I knew about sailing boats or what it's like to be a soldier and all sorts of things which I I don't know so that it it's in that sense it is it's it’s connection with the work is very referral but I suppose I mean since I'm I’m largely influenced and interested in moral philosophy uh that some of the uh reflections about moral philosophy and and about ethics or so on uh may have connected with thinking about the dilemmas of my characters but this is very very indirect and I don't uh uh philosophy such a different game from from writing fiction and the the way you write it and the prose style and everything is is utterly different and it's far more difficult well no not really like there's something which I've I work on occasionally but it's it's not uh it's not likely to see the light or very little of it well yes I don't think this necessarily connected philosophy I mean connects with religion which I've I I I mean which is travelled with me problems about religion uh I suppose I mean maybe this uh this  the consideration of moral issues in the novels is somehow intensified in a way by some philosophical considerations but on the whole I keep these things apart I think it's it's very it's terrible to be in danger of writing a philosophical novel I mean this is a lot a thing that people that writers can get away with usually in fact uh the only good philosophical novel I can think of it is really which is really absolutely philosophical Islanussay by Sauth which is a good novel and uh and full of philosophy but on the whole if if you take the case of Thomas Martin for instance when his characters start having very long philosophical conversations you know one feels well perhaps we could do without this well occasionally but not very long well the the important praise is in relation to his work um because obviously great artists uh uh can uh read uh less than perfect lives in other aspects of their activities but I I mean I think that one is uh that the contemplation of great art I was reading of great books looking at great pictures is is is somehow very good for one in a way it's it’s uh I visited the Metropolitan Museum this morning and and somehow the presence of of the of these great works is is calming and the there's something about truth I mean I think this is very difficult to explain that there's a kind of truthfulness about great art uh as one might see it in in the great you know 19th century novels which is very difficult to attain that to uh um do something to create something which is is not a a fantasy I think I'd I’d want to make a distinction between fantasy and imagination which is not the same as courageous distinction but but uh would would be a distinction between uh the expression of uh immediate feelings and the elevation of yourself in a in a work of art I mean it's very obvious case would be the the novel where the the writer is to hero and uh is always succeeding he doesn't succeed at first but he's very brave and all girls like him and so on uh I mean this would be the obvious case of something which tends to spoil the work I think some of the H Lawrence his work is spoiled by just too much Lawrence and um there's a sort of impersonality uh an ability to to uh have an image of perfection and to expel a fantasy and uh the sort of uh lesser egoistic uh cravings and uh and the kind of imagery and immediate uh expressions which uh might go with it and and to be prepared to to think him to to wait and so on I mean it's difficult as I say to to make this into any sort of program it's just that one sees this from the from the results that there there is some kind of tricks for us uh in Shakespeare and in Titian and uh in the the the work of of people who have managed to overcome egoism and and fantasy well my own work that doesn't resemble any of them because they're that they are greater great novelists but um um well I mean I I I these would be very obvious cases I mean I I like the whole tradition of the English novel from Jane Austen uh um Dickens Emily Bronte uh George Ellis and of course Henry James whom I love uh and um I I also love the Russian novel I I think in a curious way the the English-speaking people feel a great affinity with the Russians that somehow the works of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky when they're translated seem very natural to us it's as if that they were already writing in English uh they I think that we have the same feeling about Proust that he's really an English write  because obviously he is so uh uh uh he speaks to us so very directly perhaps this is just my own personal feeling whereas uh I think that Stun- Stundal and Flerbert' are more remote from us I mean we we know they're French uh uh uh but these I think these these great writers are I mean that's the great age of the novel and and it's something that won't always return to and find marvellous wisdom in um well I I think I well I I would advise actually who's just starting out the game I think it's very important to make a plan a very detailed plan before you write the first sentence I mean some people think one should write the first sentence you know George woke up and use it something terrible happened yesterday or something like this and then see what happens but I think this this may be a a a mistake what's a what’s one well anyway what I do is is to plan the whole thing in immense detail before I write uh the first sentence or write I have a plan and lots of notes and so on every chapter is planned and every conversation is planned and because I think that the imagination here works in in two stages I mean there's a primary stage where this is of course the frightening stage because you commit yourself then I mean novels a long job and it's uh if you get it wrong at the you could be very unhappy later on uh and one one should sit quietly and and let the thing invent itself I mean that's the moment when they are going to come and and help you uh uh when one piece of imagination leads to another I mean that you then you think about a certain situation then some quite extraordinary aspect of it suddenly appears I mean that you then are waiting and perhaps making notes and things and waiting for the main structure of the thing and the deep things there are deep things which the work is about to declare themselves and to connect I mean somehow then things fly together and connect with each other and generate other things and characters invent other characters as if they were all doing it themselves as it were um and one should be patient and extend this period as far as possible and then then writing it involves a different kind of imagination and work  yes at the end there could be one copy but I find this it I know that some people um like word processors but I find I do a great deal of correcting as I go along and uh I think if one had got that sort of green and black screen in front of one one would be so fascinated by the words all that one wouldn't want to change any of them also I think it is just more difficult to I mean to do in the one’s notebook one turns the pages back and wants to connect a over there with b would be twenty pages on and then this is tick would take more time if one hadn't wasn't able to command the whole thing under your hand well I yes I I do enjoy it but it did it it has of course I mean this is true of any any art form you know that there are moments when you think it's awful and you have lose confidence and its all black you can't think and so on so that there are unit that it's not all enjoyment no I mean I start thinking immediately of course about the next book or perhaps just before I e- I end one but uh uh nevertheless you know one that takes a long a long job you you mean in in this particular book well it's it's it's a long way back to to the results uh era I mean Sauth his popularity immediately after the war was extraordinary I mean people suddenly felt I mean people who’d who had nothing to do his philosophy uh suddenly felt that her philosophy for them had suddenly been invented and one could understand this that the uh the war had been so terrible and so destructive and the Hitler area had been so unimaginably awful and uh people wanted to you know to find some way of of having some kind of spirit come back into her life or some kind of sense of of girl and so on and and uh Sauths existentialist ethic would the the notion of the possibility of complete freedom and uh that you should uh get yourself into a state where you could make a choice which transcends the uh conventions and the sort of um dull sort of feeling of being con- contained and to submerged and so on this and and the the his novels to sort of reflect this her ache in a way her ache ethic did cheer people up a lot I am I don't go along with this particularly myself but it was uh and didn't really then but it had a great revivifying effect in a way oh well um yes I mean when I'm moving on in the century um well perhaps it's difficult to I had to go at it last night or to speak briefly about about structuralism uh this is something quite um  new which I started to come about in the 1960s I mean South belonged to the 40s and 50s that was his great time uh and I think the the 60s and 70s saw the the uh growth of the doctrine which Jacques Derrida represents uh which was originally called structuralism this is a doctrine which uh derives chiefly from Libby Strauss and Saussure and his influence it's influenced by Heidegger is influenced by Marx and Freud uh and I think people that after the after the Saath or or during the Saath or and people did really feel that Nietzsche and Marx and Freud had had done the job I mean they'd blown everything up and given us a vista of of something else and part of this of course was was what was called the death of God I mean the feeling that we could no longer believe in a personal God I mean I personally don't believe in in God in the traditional sense uh but I I I say I feel that well I think that religion doesn't depend I mean Buddhism and Hinduism exist with- without a personal God and I think they're they are great religions but I mean very briefly to talk about structuralism it's a it's a big complicated game this that uh probably a lot of you know how much influence Derrida has had and how many unfortunate students are bound to read his books uh or worse of course to read the books of his disciples uh uh the fundamental idea of one Canterable Goodly put this complicated business house this was a I mean Wittenstein discovered either the things which are true in structuralism were being talked about in Cambridge by Wittenstein’s disciples in the 1930s I mean he he did this this job first in a way um I mean saying things like he wasn't regard words as names of things words have meaning through their connection with other words through groups of words and um that you can't agree with Descartes that cogito ergo sum is a great starting point because you cannot have a meaning which is isolated in a single moment because meaning demands a a texture or network um and these sort of ideas were were already in the wind and uh data uh uh taking the work of the anthropologist Libby Strauss and more more even I think the patterns uh of the thought of Saussure who as a kind of hermeneutic image said we should think of language as something which exists independently of us and which makes itself uh it's it transcends us and it um it makes its own meanings and its own connections and uh we are not the masters of language rather languages is our master and this such ideas and also the idea is taken from Freud and others but about the limitations of human consciousness and the fact that we have unconscious motives unconscious desires and so on uh added up and together with with the things which about the end of the era of Descartes which Wittenstein had also been interested in uh brought about um um um with Jared as assistants a kind of metaphysic I mean um Derrida likes to say that Heidegger is the last metaphysician but uh uh his brand of structuralism or deconstruction or whatever you now call it uh is is a metaphysical system I mean there's no earthly reason why we have to believe in it in fact well well oh wait wait I mean the part of the uh package uh is that um the writer the artist uh is a kind of innocent who doesn't know what he's doing uh he doesn't uh and this would be true actually of of every ordinary person and the the non-ordinary people I'll mention in a minute the uh ordinary person doesn't know uh um he doesn't know himself and he doesn't know what his words mean because he can't extend himself he can't uh as it were transcend language and see what the network is which surrounds his speech and one might say that um I mean this is a sort of truism that of course we we don't uh know ourselves perfectly and uh we are prepared to accept a certain amount of what Freud says about unconscious motives that perhaps only very little something uh uh and uh we um we are transcended by all sorts of systems of which we don't understand but uh nevertheless uh we continue to be uh truth-seeking individuals uh and we do the best we can to explain the world and there's no sense in thinking of the actual existence of the whole of this network but this is what uh Derrida are urges people to imagine and it's very easy to do this because this is old-fashioned determinism really I mean it is the feeling which people often had when they began to be so frightened of science I mean that scientists could frighten us very much by telling us if we don't know what we are I mean we're made of genes and and chromosomes and things and um I mean some people's I mean I even saw an article in The Times not long ago saying you cannot blame anybody for anything because our genes determine us well but I mean if human life is is concerned with uh with our experience of our freedom and and of good and evil and uh these this picture of dead as this terrible white coded linguistic determinism uh then it feels uh the favoured few I mean it's a real picture of the senseless mass and the initiated few which Saaths this art also has because Saath really is in sympathy with the heroic people who throw off the bonds of conventional and are really free and make their choices freely uh so in the in literature the poor benighted writer who doesn't know what he's saying uh has to be uh uh interpreted or deconstructed by the expert so that there is a I mean and this in any university this is can be almost sinister that there are persons who who see young people like to feel particularly young people studying English literature they're not they certainly not content just to to read um Saussure Shakespeare Spencer etc etc and try to understand them and to study the background the historical background and so on they feel as a kind of science which they can master which will help them to um um to understand any text and and to see what's in it and to sort it out and then the one end result is that the uh the deconstructed work is taken to be the work itself so that that is you know that the work of the original artist is set aside and what we are given is the scientific statement made by the critic well I think this is I think this is sinister and I think it means that these poor um um students really very often are bullied into um umreading these very difficult works instead of enjoying literature you you mean not not about the characters in the books well I don't know I haven't really achieved anything yet well the oh the one’s always just contented with what one has done really uh also uh and also of course one's always afraid that even the thing once has has done one can’t one can't do again uh I don't know I think I think artists live in the present really I mean that they have to uh think so much well I mean you know that you are an artist but that you have to think vey intensely about well what you are doing in the present and and not to bother about if I said forget about the past and what what you've done and because it's what you think you can do next which matters and a lot and one always hopes to one always hopes to do better and I mean for any writer it’s it's terribly discouraging if if uh somebody when one's written lot of books says oh I I loved your first novel uh by hot sinks when they say because the early you know that suggests it's been a downhill all the way I said well I I she was a friend of mine and I was very fond of her and uh I stayed with her in Ireland and I I um I somehow felt very close to her through Irishness and so on and she was a darling I don't think that her books particularly influenced me I didn't I didn't really I didn't read all of them but uh I I don't think that they were a major influence actually but I think I think they extremely good and um they're getting you know they're not read as much as they used to be I think that particularly the later books a marvellous marvellous novels I mean she was great novelist and a great storyteller I mean the great short story writer I mean some of her short stories I think as good as any any there are are in in English and I I missed her very much when she departed well the the theatre is such a a different game and um it's it's I think it writers of the writers of fiction of novels are are pleased when they're they can see something of uh their work on the stage and hear people uttering their lines and so on uh but a play is made of lines and it's got to its got to I mean the miracle about the theatre is why people stay there right why don't they get up and go uh uh and it's it’s requires a it's not at all easy to write a play and to to to some kind of magic which is involved I the first uh my first adventure the theatre it was very very pleasant one because I I worked with Jack Priestley uh JB Priestley who um um worked with me on making a play out of out of a novel of mine called a Severed Head and uh he he said to me ducky this is a difficult game you know and very few people can succeed at it and uh these people as only few people succeed and they make money but many people are trying to make money and can’t so it was not that he was uh uh primarily concerned with money but he thought that really uh uh if it was all that easy everybody would be doing it but it is it is very difficult uh to compress the reflections of one's characters and the um uh great pattern of of of a novel and the thoughts of people which you could go on rambling you see for ages about what somebody thinks and you can define their their thoughts and their character in a way very um much more successfully perhaps in a novel now all this has to be made into drama where it is a matter of of of lines and short speeches uh uh and uh actual actors and so on um I think the forms are so different that It it it's so you know it's they can't possibly be compared I mean a play is much more like a poem uh it's it's got to have form and it's it's it's got to be uh um it's got to be beautiful as it were uh I mean if one thinks of the great long rambling novels of the of the great novelists of the century if it takes of War and Peace or something like that it's the greatness of that thing is it it is so much in it it goes on and on but if you are going to make a play you've got to have a to make your point very um quickly and and that it's got to be a simpler point then the the novel can afford to to deal with sorry I know I'm rambling on uh uh you you are mentioning um um a well I think that's one of the things one one thinks about uh very early on in the sort of primary stage it it's um it's it's a very good um I mean at a certain moment I think it's a very good way of gathering up the whole of the novel all the characters are allowed to write a letter and this somehow uh uh brings one up to date the whole of the situation about what people have been thinking which you haven't been told for um uh great many pages then appears very characteristically for each person in in the letter so it is a means not a dodge one can use all the time but it's uh uh it’s somehow oh there there's moments when it seems very appropriate uh perhaps I could answer the second one first no I don’t see myself as a gothic novelist no um I think the word gothic I mean it’s an ambiguous word um is often used of uh I mean a writer like Peacock for instance would be a gothic novelist um um I mean it's it's as a critical term it it seems to me a rather diminishing one it suggests that one is writing about uh romantic Horrors or something of that sort perhaps you weren't using the word in that sense yes I I think these I wouldn't use these uh philosophical or semi-philosophical concepts in in talking about I think the novel must escape from from this and uh I think it's dangerous for a novelist to be influenced by by philosophical abstractions aware but to take the case of Kant I mean I've written in other contexts about content about and about the sublime and the beautiful and uh roughly the the the difference between the sublime and the the beautiful is that the beautiful uh has form and produces uh a perhaps calm contemplation completion of art and so on the sublime is something frightening uh in human life when suddenly it's a very good concept very interesting concept when you suddenly realize that you're surrounded by measureless things I mean things which transcend you uh outside you I mean in nature or in um in science and I think we we probably are are are ready to feel these feelings now even more than in Kant’s time I mean that the sublime the sort of popular sublime was that were thinking of the Romantic movement would be looking at looking at the Alps or watching a waterfall or something and seeing something absolutely chaotic I mean the experience if one's flying over the Alps and one looks down on this endless senseless empty stony scene and you think you know it gives you a kind of freesome which it Kant then says is a should be a good freesome because you you've realized first of all that all these things transcend you they're dangerous they're terrible I mean one might think about um scientific explorations of the universe or something this way one doesn't understand them on the other hand you turn return to yourself and you realize that you are a rational individual and and that you know you can snap your fingers at all that stuff because you you have the power of your own freedom and your own moral judgment uh I I don't think this has any direct connection with with the with the novels but there's something about it which I I like
