well we all of course what you have to bear in mind we were all just hackers compared to the players none of us can play I think one of the most uh important things I've learned playing tennis the last few years and the experience I've had playing with with players there's the great players is an appreciation of the levels of the game tennis has been exploding over the past 10 years I have until what something like 20 million players we have now and uh I think almost all of them imagine there were three levels of the game them the best player in their club and Rod Laver you know and in fact are about 17 levels of play in in the game and uh as I'm sure you would agree with me the opportunity to to be on a court with the likes of Emerson or Smith  it sure is I remember one of the most humiliating and agonising experiences of my life in front of all these people you should see how many tries it took but uh I was about 12 years old and I went to a new school moved to a new town and I went in school and you know the teacher calls the roll the first day to connect the names with her faces and she got to my name and she's reading she said Charlotte Heston uh and she’s reading and she said Charlotte Heston and she said where's the little Heston girl I got into three fights that day I had a marvellous time on it I'm a great admirer of dick Lester and for once I'm not playing one of the main cheese's I play Cardinal Richelieu who's the villain I know I had great fun in it well yeah I do a lot do a lot of that the unusual thing about Richie Lieu for me I've played a lot of historical characters but Richie Lieu was the only guy I've played about a bigger nose than I did so I got to wear a false nose which kind of fun you know  but when I'd played Ben Hur they never suspected the race was fixed they  there you are see I there are a lot of marvellous actors who are not comfortable and I suppose maybe therefore not effective with Korean parts who an offhand example Steve McQueen is I think one of our best actors they're all Newman's another but neither of them has ever done  that may be part of it I don't know but I've done well I was framed for that kind of thing on the stage I've done a lot of period parts I suppose he's an odd odd thought I guess I've done more period parts than any other actor in the country well I think it's a lot of actors are bugged by the wardrobe you know but putting on the costume yes and you see them between the takes they take off as much of the outer part as they can because they can't sit down comfortably in it and but uh you've got to make it feel like clothes not wardrobe this sounds really ridiculous uh I'll really get a reputation as a freak but when I'm doing a period part I often wear some of at home at no no kidding no kidding Scouts honour I don’t mean the whole bit but uh just like when I played Michelangelo you can wear the tights and a shirt at home at night and it that's in the first place Elizabethan wardrobe is some of the greatest wardrobe ever developed they didn't come for themselves they came for Cagney we were all very happy about that and the American never did I he was still working when I first came to Hollywood but I never had the good luck to work with him which is my loss he's one of our great
