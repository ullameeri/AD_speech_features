yes I I thought that was rather apparent I got the idea no the only announcement I have is that the Lord willing I'll continue to be governor of 1974 and beyond that yes it wasn't too many years ago that that I switched and uh of course I wasn't in office at the time when I did it it didn’t I don't remember any great front-page stories about it at that time yeah no and uh no one has there's certain restrictions in this job I have found that uh limit you’re your that’s right yes little little busy yeah I don't I don’t think it speaks well for our civilization and where we've gone I think there's a certain touch of decadence in it no I didn’t think that was I thought that was fans that agreed with me it takes more talent to entertain with your clothes on yes I was not only disappointed I was a little indignant about that uh here is a here's a nation that was one of the founding nations the last of the big four and is still alive Chiang kai-shek from World War two and uh all these years they have abided by the bylaws and the constitution of the of the uh United Nations and also while only fourteen million people are on Taiwan they have paid their dues or assessment to the UN on the basis of the 700 million Chinese on the mainland and uh I know the United States had recognized it didn't have the votes any longer to keep Red China out but the uh by dropping their opposition the understanding was that other nations would not ask Taiwan and the plain truth of the matter is they just plain double-crossed the United States  well I don’t I don't know if anything they could have done I happen to be on that Asian trip uh that the president had asked us to make for him at the time and meeting ambassadors in six of the Asian countries and meeting the the heads of state of all of those countries uh everyone was confident that this would not happen that it would wind up with both China's uh in there because that everyone was aware of the work that had been going on in the part of our country to s- to see that that happened first of all the big surprise was when the vote was taken no one expected the vote to be taken for another month and uh then there were several nations as I say that just deliberately broke their pledged word went the other way and and I just uh I thought that the United Nations uh in that action branded itself as a debating society and I honestly don't believe that the United States should feel bound by any of its votes well I think it would be awfully hard I can understand it saying it I think it'd be awfully hard for a major nation uh we all had so much hope in this organization and and still believe and I still believe that some daily the the cause of world peace is only going to come about over a table with nations willing to talk instead of in a fight so I think any nation would think a long time before they would deliver the death blow and certainly if the United States withdrew uh it would be the death blow of the United Nations but I think there are other things we could do I think that the United States for example uh while I hinted at it a moment ago I think the United States could participate in debate and discussion continue to support many of the agencies as we do that are doing good works the kind of charitable agencies and educational functions and so forth but uh just not participate in the voting and uh by not voting ourselves uh thus remove ourselves from being bound by any votes you see one thing that needs reorganization is the fact that here uh are more than uh where more than half of the in the United Nations today can carry a vote as a majority and they represent less than 10% of the world's population I uh maybe some of these people who are so strong for one man one vote ought to consider it to regard of the uh UN that is very easy to answer I could answer and I and I heard you uh speculating a little while ago out here while I was off stages uh speculating about uh what it's like to watch your movies as the hours go on late into the night  it's a little like watching the Sun you never know your had I've got I've got friends in the business to sit up to wat- look at their old shows to watch their hairline recede but um the worst movie I have never seen to this day I made a picture see when you started in this business back in that golden era they had a thing called the bee unit in the studio and I became the the hero of the bees for a while at Warner Brothers it was the Gifford part that broke me out of that and into different kind of picture but um I made some that uh they didn't well they I was um like an Errol Flynn in a you know low budget sort of way and um this picture was called Code of the Secret Service uh some people some friends of mine have tried to trick me into a projection room a couple of times to see it but uh don’t you dear of course part of it is you know  part of the blame was on us the director and myself we got mad at the producer and usually on those things they expected you to patch things up on the set you know that you'd look at the script and he'd say you can't do that and so you'd kind of cook it up and it'd come out a little better than had been written and this one we got mad at the producer and the director and I made up our minds we would shoot it exactly as it was written oh I want to tell you it reached a a real low spot when the villain shoots me and then walks away and leaves me for dead and I take a book which is a Spanish American Dictionary I just happened to be in Mexico at the time out of my pocket and I saved at the book you know if you ever need it if you ever need an endorsement call on me and then I put it in my hip pocket I suppose in case he shoots me while I’m going away and uh  well now listen the funny thing is bedtime for Bonzo was quite a box-office smash and and the funny thing is it proved a rule of comedy uh that it was a good picture it was a very funny comedy because it was based on truth it was based on the type of experiments that they've been doing a Duke University with chimps and the idea was I was a psychology professor and uh I was trying to raise a chimp as you would a baby and see how far up you could bring it in in intelligence before uh it slowed down and a child would go ahead so it was being raised in my home and uh clothes and with a crib and and all of it and Bonzo the night the picture of from Bonzo died in a fire out in jungle land they yeah and I hated that because he and I uh we we had a very great understanding we got along just fine it was a it was a good picture then to show you the other rule of comedy they violated they made a sequel which I'm happy to say I wasn't in called Bonzo goes to college and um you know and Hollywood did this a lot if a picture made money they would immediately come back with a sequel but somehow they never seem to be able to realize what it was that made the first one good now the first one was based as I say on on a basic sound premise the second one when they tried to have you believe that a chimp could make the college football team uh it was burlesque in burlesque and you know in comedy it never works uh you know well no because I've been I never had any quarrel with the uh the football players I I happen to have a strong affinity and a belief in the kind of guy does playing football today I know of some that I think could uh pull so- some administrative position in some campuses well being someone who predicted that I'm not at uh I I've not been too surprised there’ve always been people leaving but we've always had them coming in they've been coming in faster there’s there’s been an exchange the balance has just been in our favour but I think what happened is when a when a state uh grows to the size of California and has large urban centres it loses some of the appeal that would bringing the people here the people were coming here in a kind of a pioneering sense it was an new frontier new start new jobs and futures and so forth now when you grow up to being well being the most popular state in the Union you lose some of that and you find people here leaving for the same reason they're leaving states back there they're going to Alaska Arizona Oregon Washington that’s right well I I think he will yes of course uh when I was a sports announcer I also said that Max Baer would lick Joe Lewis no I I really I really do I think they're gonna be a lot of speculation I will be down to the to the to the moment but I I think the team would stick together well I know uh I disagree with the great many of them I think that uh no one is ever going to do that job to suit everyone but uh I can't I can't see a a really serious but I can see some uh gestures some symbolic things and such as entering a primary in New Hampshire or something and and almost with the idea of influencing him uh the President to change his course but I don't see anything wrong with the trip he's taken to Peking I I can understand some people being uncomfortable about it but uh the president has said he wants to go he hopes that perhaps by at least sitting and talking he can remove us a step further from war and he is uh he hasn't said he's going to give anything away or trade us down the river he has uh made it plain that he intends to keep our alliances with all the other Asian nations including the government of Chiang kai-shek and I don't see why anyone should be so disturbed well uh no it isn't conceivable I I have pledged my support and uh going to go forward on that basis no no as a matter of fact uh uh I'd like to match our environmental record here in California against that of most governments including the federal government but no that was during the campaign and my opponent said that I said that and uh that was the hardest thing to bear because it was a contrary to everything I feel I've been an outdoorsman and we I’ve had a farm or a ranch for a number of years and I wouldn't even cut down a tree on my own ranch the tragedy dick is that so many people in the country still think that there is a great threat to the redwoods and it doesn't uh do the people to California justice because probably one of the great conservation successes in the whole world has been the work of the people of California to save the redwoods there are almost 200,000 acres well maybe closer to a hundred and fifty thousand acres of the what are called the great Cathedral-like groves of ancient trees and there are there can't be more than four or five thousand acres of that kind of tree left in private hands they are all that many in our parks now well uh beyond that well here's the greatest proof I can give you when the federal government finally agreed to have a National redwood park they bought about 28,000 acres between two of our state parks now the 20,000 twenty-eight thousand acres they have could not possibly make a park the only way it can make a park it is a kind of a bridge between two of our state parks and if you join these two beautiful state parks to this twenty-eight thousand acre connecting these you will have a good National Park and this is the plan that is is being worked out now yes we've been working with a commission with the federal government for quite some time on that to do that but we have saved the redwoods now the the redwoods that are being lumbered our commercial trees if the redwood grows very fast and it may grow very old but it grows very fast and most of our lumbering in California is approaching what is known as sustained yield meaning that they won't cut any faster than the redwoods grow back in 40 years a redwood forest totally cut down has reached the height at which you can once again go in and and lumber it their their complaint is one in which now they have to admit that there are no more great Groves to be saved so now they have embarked on saying but we need a shield around them so we want you to take just some of this ordinary uh forest land around the present redwood parks and get more of that to surround them and there is a certain screening that is is done now but the people of California have done this a great many of those 150,000 acres were purchased by the people of California and given to the state so that the trees would be preserved  well the other day the Sierra Club asked me to join and I said I'd be delighted and uh I waited for the high-rise buildings in San Francisco to fall down they didn't uh but no I've always been uh in there and as a matter of fact uh we instituted long before everybody discovered ecology and long before some of our young people and I'm glad to say got so carried away uh from the first day our administration started in 67 we instituted plans whereby we said that we would no longer have highways go a straight line if it meant tearing up ecology or going through some historic area or something that they were going to have to respect those we have since won a great many national awards for uh our preservation of the scenery in doing that we have voluntarily agreed that here after all rights of ways will have to be cleared by a Joint Committee of our Parks and Recreation people as uh well as the local people and the highway commission uh to make sure that the beauty is preserved uh we're out ahead I think of most of the country in this well I don't know justhow you how you mean that or how to what you mean I suppose if he had anything other than his salary he could um he could lose that the same as anyone else could lose it by business reverses as to your income I I can say this it's very easy uh to find that the demands of the position uh exceed what you get in in the first place you you you maintain you maintain two homes you you would have to live in a capital but you know you're not gonna be there forever and so you try to keep your home where it is and uh maybe this is one of the reasons why I've been so interested in trying to get property tax reform out here uh when I when I pay the taxes or those weekends it's getting like a yacht where you you know if you have to ask how much it cost you can't afford it but uh no this you maintain two households uh and there are just things expected of you that you do and uh there's no provision for them  I certainly will she's spoken very often about what she enjoyed being here on the show and we're glad to have you here in California
