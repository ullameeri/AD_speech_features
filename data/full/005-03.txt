I would say the highlight was my golden wedding anniversary dear marriages are not common in the film industry you have to understand you are surely aware and um it's so it was great I remember there was a great turmoil about it uh and the morning Sunday the morning talk shows where the lady hosts asking and I remember one of them said to Lydia leaned forward she said now Lydia just between you and me did you never even briefly consider divorce Lydia said divorce never murder often indeed walked into the lecture auditorium at Northwestern University where as a freshman I was taking a mandatory class called fundamentals of theatre practice 8:40 that seems like a formidable thing doesn't it and there were of course seats all over and I just sidled in and sat down behind a woman like who's I could only see her hair but just stunning the first two days I didn't take a note I just looked at her hair and finally reached out in very softly stroked it now she says I pulled it I did not pull it as God is my witness from there on we became an item first and then all the guys in the school you know we were going off to the war which I did in about about a year later and I tried desperately those last months to persuade her to marry me using the soldiers old excuses you know you may never we may never meet again this may be the only thing we have even I used what I thought was a clincher I said darling you know if I get killed you get $15,000 free and clear I thought that would tip the scale but she would that didn't move it just before I went overseas I got a telegram which she still used telegrams and it said I've decided to accept your proposal love Lydia and so she came down to the camper I was in gunnery training and we were I got a two-day pass we were married and she went back to the University and I was overseas for more than two years something I learned is there's a certain value to that because everybody says the first two years of the hardest so she's the first advice I would give to any man contemplating a wedlock is remember the crucial importance of those three little words I was wrong take you a lot farther than I love you the closer you can do it you use it however you feel about it but the closer you can come to believing it the more useful it is and I think too that in the seventies the birth of the women the feminist movement betty ferdinand that lot were carrying on about how men and women were really the same and we just had to you know figure that out but it's not true of course men and women are nothing like the same different as could be but therefore and a man has to understand that things that are basically not very important to him should this carpet be left the same color or should it be more apple I don't care but a woman cares very much her choice is a very strong choice and the man who fails to recognize that is in for trouble yes we have I think since we've talked I now have two grandchildren too my son’s son Chris and John Alexander Clark Heston but a a jack if I ever saw one and he's turning on eight then our daughter uh married to a Sotheby's executive in New York he has a little daughter seems appropriate daughter for their girl serendipity that I'm a strong believer in serendipity I've encountered it all my life's the unexpected good consequences of an entirely random choice and that's worked to my profit many many times supposing with that auditorium and I sat behind the wonderful woman who became and still remains my wife supposing I've certain the other side of the aisle I would have sat behind another girl I don't know I don't I think it's just it happens the story about how I got the part in the circus picture for DeMille as my second film I had gone out was doing on Broadway plays and life television and Lydia was in a play and I got a chance to do a film which I went out and did for Hal Wallace perfectly fine producer but it was not a marvellous film it was in okay film finished the film I thought well I'll go back to New York now see next another film or whatever comes and I had been introduced to Sussel B DeMille because every actor that came on the lot was introduced to an an iconic figure before whom you played tribute and so we had talked for three minutes in his launching room and so I'm driving off the lot in a green paddock but Packard convertible now if it hadn't I hadn't and at that top of the convertible down and this wouldn't have happened if he had not been standing on the steps of his building talking to some of his people this wouldn't have happened if I had never met him this wouldn't have happened all those things being nevertheless true I saw him there in that well met him just tipped the finger to him wave and I did and he nodded and I'm told afterwards he said to his secretary who did not take down every word he spoke but a good many of them he said who was that and she flipped through her book and said that's Charlton Heston Broadway actor he made one picture dark City for Hal Wallace you ran it two weeks ago you didn't like it he said I liked the way he looked just now that we better had him in for the lead in the circus picture bingo then of course that in the won the Academy Award and I then did 10 commandments if you can't make a career out of two DeMille pictures you're in the wrong business but that is serendipity I think that's certainly true I of course was raised in hunting country in Michigan where there were maybe 15 or 20 families living scattered through what was really virgin forests still and great deal of hunting and fishing and ice fishing and all kinds of good things and that was my life my wonderful boyhood what is important to remember about the differences that seem to be erupting between England and America and over this the Second Amendment issue is that you have no Constitution indeed no other country has a constitution those wise old guys that invented the United States saw that they had an opportunity there to do something that no one had done or would do that is not only to write a constitution but then to follow it with a Bill of Rights every one of whose twelve articles every one has one purpose to defend the individual American citizen from the intrusive power of the federal government and it's it applies in your trade at home journalists and um radio people television people have our freedom of speech you say more or less what they please the Second Amendment is um in the wording of the um bill of rights is the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed and there's jefferson putted he said the object is that every man be armed um um let me give you a little poetry to Longfellow that's the Second Amendment well I think the facts demonstrate that there are now some two hundred and twenty-four million firearms in private hands in the United States that numbers remain roughly consonant since 1950 which was the time the FBI first started keeping track of how many guns there were in private hands during that what now 30 year period the crime rate has gradually reduced no it's lower than its than it's been in this century and there are just to throw a few facts at you there are 43 of the 50 states 43 states now have separate legislation allowing non felon of course it's long and for a long time been against the law for a felon to carry a fight even to touch a firearm it's a five year offense all by itself and a good thing too but those states that have this where they call it a concealed carry law the other states are have it in their legislatures and it will soon pass but what it means is that anyone who is a law-abiding citizen um goes through a background check to shoot proof that he has no felony record and he must then take a certain course in the care and feeding of firearms and then if he likes he can carry a concealed weapon now the advantage of that in fact most people I could get a a carry permit in California but it is I don't feel the need to have that but and most of the people in these states that have this concealed carry law don't in fact carry a gun most of the time the advantage is the bad guys don't know which guy is carrying and they don't know who has and it is reduced crime in those states too but I would rat- literally and truly I would rather play a senator than be one and as a as a citizen I have access to a pretty good forum I can get on talk shows um TV I go out in campaign every election cycle for candidates of both parties whose agenda I agree with whose agenda I agree and I have the best of both part of both world it in a sense and I can't explain it these things have happened to me oh ever since I got back from the war I guest coming back alive from the war and and in one piece and not long after that I became president of the Screen Actors Guild when Ronald Reagan abandoned that post to go on to greener pastures then probably even more important it means the most to me at least I was among a very small group like four or five actors that would campaign for civil rights with dr. King the studio's were horrified at the idea they said no you're gonna alienate half your audience Chuck yeah I said oh come on quit it guys and I they ended up leading the arts contingent that dr. King's 63 March and that was really one of the great moments of my life it really was yes it was oh and the civil rights was a crucial event and I was very proud to have a small part in making it happen and then I think by now it's become sort of commonplace that if um organizing some group say the Arts Committee I was on that group then I was an adviser to that group and the Los Angeles theater and these things then I um go stuff for the State Department I went to Vietnam twice and then someone said you could could you do some appearances for us as a as a man who uses guns I said sure and I did and now here I am president I think it's people now say what if they're forming some group they'll say you know Chuck Heston does this kind of stuff I think it's changed significantly in a couple of ways in the first place and this is widely debated at home the violence in film sex too explicit sex language but above all violent and there's a case to be made for that of course uh when I started making movies in 1950 if you were wounded shocked or stabbed as I frequently have been in films you staggered back clutched your chest and then as you slid to the ground rivulet of blood were allowed to come between your fingers but that was it and a few years later working for for Sam Peckinpah God rest his rebel soul uh they started blowing heads off and I as a filmmaker both actor and director I think we're coming close to the edge on that the shooting of the high school kids in Columbine Colorado both movies and of course the NRA and the video game manufacturers so those video games are enormously violent both movies and the video manufacturers are trying or claim they are trying to scale it back the next problem with films has been growing for the last few years that's the enormous increase in the cost of making them now the most ordinary little kids Saturday film is going to cost you minimum of fifty million dollars 50 million Ben Hur in contrast the most expensive film ever made and it's time was made for 14 million seven hundred thousand dollars but it would still it's it's enormous now then the other thing that disturbs me that's just I'm just as an actor um obviously they have a right to make their own choices but the number of American film actors that will not do a Play staggering there are some that do ah Al Pacino is doing one right now Dusty Hoffman did did quite a creditable and there there are a few BrianDennehy is doing Death of a Salesman but most actors will not do it now there are only three possible explanations for this one is arrogance I am too good to fool around on the stage I am too and my career's too important to greed I make too much money making movies to fool around with the salaries they would pay me to do a play and three fear what if I get it that nice none of these are valid reasons of my films I suppose it would be Ben Hur because it was so widely honoured and made so much money and so on and so on and is a very wonderful film of my own films they kind of fall into three categories one the huge epics like Ben Hur alcide 55 days it be king all that that win prizes and are huge sums of money some then there's a whole category like the the disaster films made for a while that are seldom great films but entirely watchable and they pay you obscene sums of money to do what maybe a week's work and then more important and westerns more important to me I'm proud of the fact that I've done more Shakespearean films than any American actor historical films Ben Hur of mine I think is the best although Gordon of Khartoum Khartoum is with with Olivier and Ralph Richardson it's pretty good company I think that depends partly you have to get the parts if you're going to power over anything but I have and it depends on getting wonderful parts you know we were just talking about Khartoum to act with Ralph Richardson and Olivier let's go bound to be pretty classy and I've worked with Gielgud and it's uh it the people you work with the scripts the the writers the other actors above all the directors that's uh depends on how it's going to turn out
