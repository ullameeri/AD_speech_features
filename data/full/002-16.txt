just wonderful wonderful I've been catching your show you’re great you know that’s yeah we were we were very poor I didn't we didn’t we didn’t have a yardstick to measure it by then everybody oh we did that’s where the chickens were eh eh chickens in your yard no but it was fine you know we had food to eat I remember being a occasionally I didn't get enough to eat but it wasn't um bad and we you know we’d clo- clothes on oue back it was growing up and I meant really schr- scratching for everything that you got Tom it was amazing he was a sharecropper I remember going to when I was 10 years old to uh Willshare Ohio about 15 miles and Fort Wayne Indiana but to make tomato harvest 10 cents a hamper we all up there picked tomatoes just to make huh a hamper is about this big at the top and about that it's probably half a bushel a lot of a lot of tomatoes for a dime I can make a dollar and a half a day meant I work real hard well it was no we had an old pumpkin back mandolin and all the family played and sang grandpa Campbell plays a great grandpa Jessie even sang I remember him and he was born my gracious life in 1850 he was he died when he was 91 years old and I'll never forget that old gent but um everybody played and singed so it was just natural and when I come along you know there wasn't anything left but like seventh part so that’s that’s probably why where I get my voice from and it was it was just marvellous you know we'd have musicals at the front porch at the house and the people would just know about if they'd come by be driving by say there's a musical at the camp no we got the radio station in Hope and the one in um Nashville and they had one in Prescott I there's an album I had to call I remember Hank Williams that me and my uncle are on the cover of and I was about 10 or 11 years old and we were playing the forest festival in Prescott Arkansas this all around there just you know probably a 20 mile area because you know getting around we didn't have a car no they sure aren’t they got them paid now I couldn't believe they rose yeah what a country yeah and played played some shows there on Saturday neither way that way we could play barn dances and stuff like that around there yeah but it they wouldn't no money in it at all but I didn't realize that until we went to Wyoming making a little money on the road who would go to Wyoming at the end of January you know we didn’t know how cold it was in Wyoming that's right that's right I I was I Jack Nicklaus says that about Golf Arnold Palmer says it about golf they’re not thinking about the money they wanna win tournament and I I wasn't really thinking about it it was just time it was so much easier than anything else and and I enjoyed doing it I mean as far as manual labor goes you know choppin cotton pickin cotton gathering oh man mixing the mud that they put over the pipes is what I did when I first went to Houston that was hard work so I played the guitar I started playing a little joints around Houston Texas I remember I own the old Galveston Highway um pilot in the ace of clubs the Pelican club in Galveston Texas slept in the back of seat of an old 40 Ford two doors of an and remember that uh when the when the troupe started coming through the Albuquerque there you know like people would come through who showed Webb Pierce come through yeah Faron Young came through Albuquerque was there and we had a we had a radio show five days a week so when the acts would come through I remember John Pain is that the guys name John Wayne but John Pain came through he was promoting a movie and they'd come on our radio show  uh Ferron Young show came through yeah and Ferron came down to promote the show and his special guest was Elvis Presley and that was on a Sunday night and I got to go down and see him in the raw I mean I saw Elvis and the three guys and it was the most incredible thing I've ever seen and Ferron was smart enough at that time after he went on last one night he said all them girls Glenn say senator we want Elvis we want Elvis anyway it was a Ferron Young show but Ferron would go on first that part on and they’d to introduce a special guest Elvis Presley it was great fun that’s so I knew that there was money to be made in the business you go boom you're hanging around with the wrong people that type of thing uh that's how I got into it and when you get into it it's like you know um alcohol and drugs don't mix they don't mix in a marriage not at all the marriage out the window and then you get to wondering why maybe it's my fault maybe just fun and you just keep doing it that that I went it went for about six years yeah I did no 70 the the the the cocaine didn't start till um the late seventies like signing 75 that yeah you know try this I didn't know what it was you know fine you know it all of a sudden you feel like the left side of your face is gone I said well I like that you know that’s just stupid you know but when you're drunk to begin with you don't notice it true I was true it was I did I just went out and thought I'd feel like what it was a wallet with a hog I guess  I wasn't I wasn't the morning drinker it was in an eve when an evening started the second show sometime I'd cancel some second shows in Vegas sometimes yeah because of it but the second show I'd be I just go out and wing it you know it was just but it was just it was just stupid time that's all I know it's in the book that is exactly right and it shows uh like the guy asked me uh he said oh yeah I said it's in the book that if it can keep one person from going through what I went through because some people can't come back from it from they get to hooked on it I know a lot of people that's quit drinking and they die yeah for some reason but um I said if this can keep one person from going through the hell that I went through during that period I didn't realize how bad it was till I got out of it and looked at it I'm seeing people and I said it's worth writing the book you know besides  he's done we’ve done this the hope turn in that his house to get he throws a party and I ask Frank I said how can anybody right an unauthorized autobiography and just ask him that made him mad he said you know and I that that was in the back of my mind and my manager to Stan Schneider is my manager yeah you know and he said um he said we should write one before and unauthorized and I said I'm gonna I'm gonna say it like it was period I bought it I gotta tell you know you can't you know otherwise I'd be I’d be like whitewater if I did you know I've something else to be coming out every week if you don't tell the truth upfront  she's bullish in the industry oh well the high point was I think getting to do the Summer Brothers Smother show with that cast of writers and everything that was that just that exploded Glen Campbell into this thing that I never dreamed it was well it was the forth runner Summer Brothers Mothers shown and went right into the Glen Campbell Good Time Hour um that was probably one of the high points of my life and um the low points was um at the end of like 1980 that area when it was when the drugs and the alcohol were real bad and another divorce you know and um going through that that was really one of the low points of my life when I lay there in a I'd cry and pray you know for deliverance and low and behold it came I heard it on the radio I heard it on those it's KNX here and it just knocked me out because I was that's when I was going through the divorce and and it just hooked me and in second verse says and that's it that's hey that makes sense to me but it’s such a great hook little kids that come up you know or their dads would say look Glenn my son can sing one of your songs this little for your kids would sing I say yeah son it’s great and they are so cute you know no I'm not on the record with them I started with him in 1960 there was after Tequila it was Seals and Crofts and myself a guy named Bob Morris and they gave him Jerry Cole on guitar and um it was great fun we start  on the road with Jack's God Danny and the Juniors on that William Morris tour you know yeah I wasn't on to Tequila I was on Limbo Rock a big instrumental hit we had when I wasn't with the Champs oh yeah from from Inception almost I've been through Pet Sounds I was on their records um and I was on the road live with them playing bass and and you know  oh my god I thought I'd go crazy the first week Glen Campbell goodtime theatre state of the art Tom Tom has never been
