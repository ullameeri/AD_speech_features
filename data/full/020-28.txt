Senator Therman on Meet The Press your rival program made it clear that he completely disagreed with me on civil rights uh as far as this problem of law and order is concerned I am for law and order Hubert Humphrey is for law and order George Wallace is for law and order how we would do it would be quite different and as far as my programme is concerned I’m the only one of the candidates who has laid out a precise program for stopping the rise in crime and for re-establishing freedom from fear that’s the difference between Nixon and Wallace Wallace is against I am for that’s the difference I’m only concerned that the people understand what is the law and what my position is the law says specifically that funds should not be withheld from a district uh for the purpose of creating racial balance uh the law says that funds shall be withheld from a district which does segregate let’s begin with where we’re gonna get the money first of all there is going to be at least a 15 to 17 billion dollar increase in revenue because of growth in the economy second I believe we’re going to have savings savings through the new uh kind of programmes that I’ve indicated uh that will probably amount in the ne- reach the neighbourhood of between 4 and 6 billion dollars will now come to 21 billion dollars that’s per year yes that’s in terms of consolidation and their agencies and so forth and also some programs particularly in the poverty area like the job core that I think should be dispensed with uh and finally uh as far as the cost is concerned I have costed out all my programmes I’m quite aware of the fact that I might be the next President I know that my first job is going to be able to prepare a budget my total increase as far as all spending programs are concerned would be approximately 10 billion dollars a year and I should also point out that Hubert Humphrey uh when he talks about what this program would cost he really isn’t much of an expert uh his a man who already has come out for programs that would add 70 billion dollars to our total spending if you wanna start uh the Cornel Committee report would cost 15 billion dollars uh his new marshal plan to the cities would cost 30 billion dollars his new program that would bankrupt the social s- security system would cost another 15 billion dollars and the other miscellaneous program would cost 15 billion more uh I’m simply pointing this out that major difference perhaps between a Nixon a uh presidency and a Humphrey presidency is that he has been known as a big spender the the most expensive senator he would be our most expensive president I would not be uh but I’m going to seek to it that the United States remains verse as far as our defence is concerned and we can do that not at the cost of 50 billion dollar we can do that at the cost that I have indicated
