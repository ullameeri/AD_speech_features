well thank you very very much it's uh nice to be here and being almost 90 uh damn nice to be anywhere drill instructor yeah well they also call them drill sergeant well it was in the family and uh when I enlisted in 1943 uh uh there was a a very large uh group of recruits heading out to San Diego and the major that was in charge of that uh knew my background and my dad from the time I was four years old I met with my dad who was uh with Armstrong Car Company but he was also very proud to be a Marine and he uh would take uh up to uh a kind of boot camp type situation uh just a little bit inside of of Wisconsin and uh the kids that came up with their dads or whatever I was four years old we had our own little potchunk and our own little uh drill and we also had our little wooden rifles so I knew the marine for him before I knew the national anthem anyway I’ll take that of and then uh I'm very proud of being a Marine the have you ever heard the Marines’ do uah yeah like that well I'm the one that uh taught taught them how to do that uh when I took them through boot I got their head shaved and their gear their M1 and uh I ran them out to the uh pa- past the parade ground and over to the boondocks and uh I would sit them down I said OK I'm gonna give you some ideas of what we are going to accomplish and you better be part of that uh thrush otherwise uh you're you're going to have a very bad time for me I said yeah yeah uh I'm going to give you a three party breaks today if you have to go in between those you got to go you got to go except I got to hear you when you're coming out OK I got to know you're coming out so as you get up let me hear it and that's how that that's is yeah I uh mean one way or the other in uh right out of boot camp they made me a drill instructor and I uh spent a lot of time up in around Pendleton and that whole area there and I just decided that I uh wasn’t going to go to law school and I on on one of the one of my visits up to uh Hollywood which was the place you know for the servicemen to go and the Hollywood canteen they had food and all kinds of dessert they had the most beautiful girls servants there helping you and so forth and uh one way or the other the this lady uh came up to me and said uh we would like to uh we would like to have you uh be part of a show uh and do an interview with Virginia Mayo which was a big stage show uh will you do it and I said well when is it she says it's on Tuesday and said ma’am you know Marines don't get out on Tuesday and she said well what if I call you a drill instructor I and I said that's fine so anyway they call them anyway uh she started interviewing the three of us and uh finally I mean she asked the same question from all of us I was the last one to answer it uh why do you want a date with me a blind date with me and I looked and I said because ma'am if I if I don't win uh that I can't go back to the base my my commanding officer said they want you to do their show you want to do it and I said well yeah you have to be off uh on a Monday and Tuesday and I said yes he said okay I'm going to give you that but if you don't win don't come back she was but the the wonderful thing about it is that she uh I had all of these uh beautiful uh golden girls they called and they were under contract to going studios and each one was more beautiful than the other about 12 of them and she invited me to the studio and uh then I met the girls and uh one of them said uh uh we we we'd like you to come see where we live and I said eh OK so it was it Sweetser and along prey to me the old yeah the old Wally Reed mansion and that's on the uh the south side of the uh sunset uh anyway uh there were uh 12 or some of the most beautiful girls you ever saw in your life living there and I started dating one of them and uh one of the others she introduced me to uh over the Idle Apino and uh one thing led to another well to get out of the Marine Corps uh I went over and the uh the mother uh called her mom took care of the place uh she opened the door and she said I come out then you're just in time for lunch and I went and these girls uh about half of them or more came down to lunch in their nightgowns their bikinis their little pants and I said a few of them were more reserved so she said if you would like uh to uh work here whatever I'll give you a free room and board uh and make uh a five car garage whatever it was just so you can make that into your home and uh anyway that's where I I lived there for about twenty five pounds I lost twenty five that’s it seriously I had little cards made up said exterior decorator but it was a uh it was a fun deal and one of the things that uh uh that happened to me was uh uh well let's put it this way Susan Cabot was under contract to Universal and I drove her to my home on the way uh we stopped at the red light uh right near Fairfax and I said over there see the bank that's where I keep all my money and as I said that this guy comes running out with a big sack of cash that he’s he’s just robbed the joint I said take care of the car and I jumped over and I ran down and caught the guy threw him up against the goddamn uh car slapped the hell out of him and took him by uh his hair the arm around up on the back and uh maybe actually around his throat marched him back into the uh bank back into the back and by that time uh the press started arriving all the people from the newspapers and various uh people that would would cover a story like that and they came in and they looked at him to me they said uh this is just it just a publicity stunt and the guy who I had and said yes well I'm buying this very uncomfortable position but he couldn't move so he turned around and said no it’s really him yeah it’s uh that's an exact word by the way and it uh was more uh the makeup artist at Universal uh I told them I wanted to do a bald head for the Seminal uh of the film called Seminal and uh Tony Hwen and uh they said oh those guys those guys the way you look is so phony funny and I said no no I will actually shave my head and they said you would I said yeah but I want to make sure that I'm not put on layoff because you only got you get I think it was 12 weeks a year where you were put on layoff they didn't pay it I don't want to be put on layoff until my hair grows back I said oh yeah for sure that's OK whatever so about every third or fourth day I would shave my head so I I I for about three years I didn’t have to go on layoff yes but uh yes but more important was the opportunity uh that presented itself I didn't ask for but when I uh they well I went there the first day they took me to my dressing room and it was Spencer Tracy's dressing room wow that's a Spencer Tracy for those of you that are old enough to know was one of the great actors of all time he also was a very warm and wonderful individual he was a very nice guy well uh the point is that when Josei she went to uh well I hope I get it right I try to think of the name of the high uh the school Columbia Missouri and uh her roommate said when they graduated uh on our way I know you got to go up north to your family but I'd like you to see where I was raised in Tombstone and in L.A. anyway so you won't she went with uh Josie went with uh her and they in in Tombstone uh it was very very lively at that time and she went on to like anybody else with the Long Brown Saloon and uh she uh met Wyatt Earp and uh they get along very well and he asked her uh uh if he could take her to dinner he did and she did and of course uh what followed that was kind of a natural thing for Wyatt and uh Josie told her roommate uh uh that she was going to stay for a while in in Tombstone and uh so uh the father who had planned this tremendous wonderful Jewish homecoming for his daughter with a lots of people the neighbors and so forth and so on and she uh she didn't make it there and the father said if I meet him I'm going to kill this son of a bitch but anyway when she uh did get uh out of there finally she went up to her dad uh and uh the bottom line is that uh her dad was absolutely furious that she had done that and so when Wyatt died uh Jose called her dad and said OK you got your wish Wyatt’s dead what do I do with him he said cremate the son of a bitch and bring him up here we’ll bury him and he they did bring him out and he's buried in a Jewish cemetery just on the other side of uh the uh mountain hills uh from the San Francisco airport there's a Jewish cemetery out there and that's where Wyatt is buried with Josie well yeah that that happened because of Norman Cousins who uh very much uh well he he was uh a a a good friend and and and he uh knew he he wrote a letter to Schweitzer tell me about this guy that was uh interested in meeting him and adored him and all that and I got a letter back from Schweitzer saying that Dr. O'Brien and his party would be welcome him inside he thought I was a doctor and I flew over it took me three different planes to finally get to Liberia uh and the last plane was uh a prop and uh when we landed on this dirt airstrip that the nose of the plane actually touching the jungle I got out and uh they took me down to the room what's called a pero which is a walk in there and in it for these six lepers that provided the paddle power so I got in I got into the uh uh back of the uh back of the pero dead there was an extra paddle and picked up the paddle and paddled with it well I started it after returning uh from Xing uh Schweitzer and uh uh we now have about ninety eight point five percent or whatever every public and private eye who sends their top tenth graders uh to a program but I make it very specific that I'm not looking for great points I want somebody that has a leadership potential so give me your worst your worst guy so I just have a lot of them that went along with that and they would give me uh the so-called bullies and I now have a new program that I'm going to be doing which is just for bullies and the bullies throughout the country and uh to show them actually how you can get as much attention they can make money and if they were just take this uh negative attitude that that they had turned around 180 degrees and uh so that's that's going along very well the book is uh well I I a lot of fun doing it should be about it should be about uh could be about four four times the size uh this is Debbie Reynolds up here and that's me uh my costume is my uh tie and I used to run around Beverly Hills with my tie yeah I remember anyway and that's uh my gosh uh uh anyway this is a Schwarzenegger and Nancy Reagan and this is Jimmy Stewart and that's uh Mrs. Ford and President Ford right there and this guy here down here that that I wish we had the the full shot but I I still feel I mean whales Africa uh uh Texas town and uh I had a great horse and uh one way or the other at a second or third day we were uh going through the woods to uh film and uh all of a sudden this huge python drops on top of me and well he he knocked me off the horse of course and the horse scared the hell out of me ran and unfortunately about 100 feet after his so run stepped into some kind of a hole as I busted his leg we had to shoot him but the uh the python became a good pal and he would he would follow me around and he would climb up and have himself around me she’s very sexy
