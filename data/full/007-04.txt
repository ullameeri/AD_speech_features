I know I know well I don't know but I mean I I pinched her name didn't I Windsor um it is a family name incidentally ladies and gentlemen I tell you what happened when I when I was I was in a musical my name was Barbara Ann Deeks and they said that's not a very good name Barbara at 15 I said oh isn't it they said no no no so we thought we'd change it so it's either Ellis which was my my family name or Windsor which was another family name well that year Ruth Ellis got on didn't she so that wasn't suitable and and but it was the coronation so that was it so I've been Windsor ever since well thank you thank you but actually my boobs ain't that big but I have to tell you something I only take size two as you see I used to have a very little I used to have this very little waist you see and I kind of had I had a bit of a bosom but when I walked it was almost like I was teetering over so everybody thought I'd bigger knockers than I have if you actually look at that camping scene I mean it's only a poor little right boob it's not a lot and that's all I ever showed it’s all I showed there and a bit of bum one day you know I was I can’t believe it I no but I was appalled because you know you know the silly old story don't you that that it said in the script that Bab's got you know has to have a bikini where she's doing her exercises and then it has to fly off I said look it won't fly off it will go on the floor we'll think of something we’ll  so they came up with this idea of a of a fishing rod with a with a hook on it and this this was the carry-on camping where it was in the heart of winter uh they they were so mean oh god they were so mean that lot that they wouldn't go on location so they they got a field at the back of pinewood where we used to film they sprayed the mud green uh put uh green uh painted the the the the trees put green leaves stuck them on there you see so anyways it wasn’t uh hot right in November it was so I'm doing this and they got and then I said oh I got very nervous about showing my bosom or anything like that and so they got this lovely old boy who was retiring the next day so anyway so we did it I have to stand up when I do this so they we did it so Kenny's going come along Barbara off they go off they so it did it anyway the first time it didn't come off and I got pulled into the mud he said tell the director all right get out mop her down gotta go again oh they don't only want you to do one take you see the second take he said don't forget don't show anything because we had a we had a um a sensor in those days called Jen John Chavellian the film sensor so anyway so I went again and it went off but I went but hattie hattie went like that with my arm and I flashed the right boob oh oh we're gonna have to go again they said right so anyway when they took it into John Chavellian and said we've got two two of this scene one with showing the boob one not we'd like to go with showing the boob and John Chavellian looked at it and he said well I don't think miss Windsor's right boob is going to corrupt the nation we'll go with it so yeah I I I don't know yeah that well no I'll tell you about men they really want to give me one night or no no no I've heard them say oh this girl oh I could really give you a or no I don't you don't do you don’t do anything for me yes once I started I thought this is nice I like this yeah but he came to me one night and I said I said no no no I’m not that kind of a girl Les Condo the trumpet player that’s who I yeah Les Condo I know yeah oh yes Condon and uh but I I loved Ronnie Ronnie Scott I thought he was fantastic I got very much in well this was my agent Peter Charles at the at the time um I he said look I'm gonna uh send you for an audition for uh the Ronnie Scott band Annie Ross she was the great greatest jazz singer she's been taken ill and they're looking for someone to go on tour so I'm not that's not me I'm all hi Sunny Side of the Street  very like that you see so anyway I went down to Ronnie's original club which was in Gerard street and there were six girls lined up you see and I was little and they were and they were all coming out and um going and doing all that bit and I came out and suddenly pointed to me Ronnie went I love her that’s the one and I but I said why me he said well you had two obvious things you know I never get he he said uh uh uh meet me in Leicester Square with all the boys in the band nine o'clock on Monday morning and they said bring a cocktail dress and I only had a bridesmaid's dress which my mother had made me so I took this bridesmaid's dress and my mother sat up all night putting extra little flowers on that and the first thing Ronnie did when I walked and I sat he said you sit there and I sat on the band with all the band and he went which makes me think he didn't employ me for me voice so there we go no absolutely not no no no no I I mean it because I still now don't think I'm I'm sexy I've never thought I'm sexy I I'm I'm I no honestly I can’t no there's like I fought for ten and a half you know I mean I'm not sexy I mean little Kylie Minogue she's only four she's sexy but no not me I'm not honestly and I've never used it you can but in a funny films funny I mean can you imagine me doing all that with a fella and no I'm quite quite shy I used to have to have a few drinks to get get going I believe me well Morris that was ah now I'll tell you about Morris that was difficult because when they broke up the Bee Gees I was doing a musical called single root soul which was based on Marie Lloyd and we wanted somebody to play the jockey and they got Morris Ned Sharing god bless him the great Ned Sharing came up to me one day said he's got no balls on stage Bab he's got no balls whatsoever you've got to do something so I said would you like to have dinner one night would you like to have dinner he said yes so we sat and and I uh we had this dinner and then I said where would you like to go my friend she said let's go and have coffee he said look Barb he said let's get it over and done with let's go to bed and then maybe right because he knew that he wasn't giving it on stage so he went around a little moment and it was lovely he was better tell me any lady here would you have turned down George Best no I tell you what happened with George I they were having a premiere of a carry-on in Manchester and suddenly I heard this uh uh these girls and there was this vision this absolute vision in the 60s he was so beautiful and he we we anyway in the bar afterwards he came over to me and he started talking to me and I said to him look don't waste your time with me darling I said you've got all these lovely ladies after you and he said when do I ever get to talk to somebody like you well that did it that did it you know what I mean so I was that was it a magic moment again it was great he was fabulous people always say to me how do you survive Barbara how are you always like that you know so I say because I turn off I I go indoors and me and Scott we have a little postmortem about what we've done and then I turn off and then suddenly he said to me Barbara you're not switching off you are 24 hours a day Peggy Mitchell I said don't be silly he said no he said you are he said uh you you'll talk to me and then you'll go off get your head in the script they started doing Saturdays as well um and I thought but that was a a big leveler when he said that and I thought uh and I'd lost a lot of friends I'd lost Danny Larue I'd lost John Emma and I'd lost Mike Reed uh Gareth Hunt yeah they were they're all going very very very quickly and uh and and Wendy going it was and I just thought maybe and I I I I kind of thought to myself what am I doing I I’m oh god look I don't like saying hard work you can't say that not when our soldiers are out there fighting and then the nurses and you know uh uh fella stuck down the pit with miners the uh you know you you can't say you know it's hard work but it is the hours are long hours that's all I was doing was was learning learning learning yes it was it was and he's very honest with me Scott and he said it's not nice you said you're not laughing yeah he said you're not laughing anymore you don't joke around and I I and you know I'm now I feel a bit old Barb coming back you know so uh that that was that yes and uh but let uh let me tell you it was very very difficult every time I say okay I'll tell them I didn't it took nearly two years to make that that decision oh it did absolutely yes first time I'd ever got an award for my acting I've got loads of awards for me bits and pieces but I had the very first one yeah for these and all but never ever for my acting and it it was it was amazing and I the the awful thing is I loved it I loved it so much I love that whole thing of going in and you know and the wardrobe hello Cathy hello Zari the makeup guy I loved all that you see yes I have yeah I yeah I yeah I I've been lying if I didn't say that you know well I I did a couple of them before Steve I asked round to the house and he walked and he said what's up so I said look he said don't tell me don't tell me you know and I said well I think it's about time but I want you to know yeah yeah I died  yeah I do and I'm getting emotional now because uh well I love that show oh Scott but um yeah it's yeah I miss I miss the camaraderie you know and they're always phoning me I say don't phone me don't phone me I I didn't for a long time but I watched it this week I didn't because there's no Queen Vic I d- I d- I didn't but when once I see that new Queen Vic that's when it's going to hit me again but you can't you know it's uh what can I do I I I since I've left it's been wonderful I mean I haven't stopped I look look I could never come on your show before because EastEnders would never let me so it’s true that is the truth you see and I I remember that this morning I thought uh you got no excuses Barb you said yes you said but uh  yes you do eight against it across each other and you do it all out of out of sync all out of order well it would be uh it would be five five to six six days a week and uh oh it's 13 hours yeah you you see they don't allow you to get into work once you get into the studio let's say your makeup time is 7 30 8 o'clock that's the time they allow and then after that I think it's 12 hours you know so it it is a long yeah yeah yeah and the thing about me Peggy she was always in the front wasn't she yes I was yes I know I know it it did it yeah yeah but I I loved it I absolutely adored it but I didn't know it had taken me over because you can so easily play a part and it can take you over but uh there's a two girl and June oh June June June oh but she was so upset and she still is about it she said how could you leave me it's because I love June Brown she's the most wonderful 83-year-old ever I mean she is so hip in real life I cannot tell you she wears when she goes out she has a hair cut around like that and she has all these kind of hippie tight clothes and all she could be very very smart you know Chanel and she's just wonderful she's just a wonderful actress she can take a piece I hate her because she should just take a script and she go oh yeah I know that you know like that I loved her I missed pam very much because we started to work a lot get together with the with the funnies you know which was lovely I don’t miss well actually there isn't really anybody no I mean everybody knows how I had a wear with Jessie but you know at the end of the day you have a well you don't talk for a little while and then she's she's having a baby bless her and then you see the baby and you grab each other and say oh sorry sorry you know that's it I'm not one to argue not get on even people I don't like and there have been a couple of people I refuse to let them get me down no honestly no there isn't there isn't you know there isn't I I do get on with people I I I do I even people that are not really my cup of tea I'll go out my way to make you know make me like them well you see it's all out of sync I did that final scene walking well I thought they were going to burn me to death didn't I thought that's it I've got when they when I worried about the fire and we're going to make a a whole new Vic in uh the George Lucas studio at El street I thought that's it I've had it you know well because I said don't tell me what my my um last scene will be or whatever you know whatever you say is is okay by me no I didn't I did not until the the week before I got that that script I didn't want to die I that's cheeky of me after saying I'm going I know I just wanted to think she was out there that was it you know well I I just knew that she was wasn't to break down uh what I wanted to do was just walk and thought let's see how long before I have to turn around and look at the Vic and I almost if you look I almost get past it and I couldn't I had to look back you know right right at the end  you silly cow silly cow Scott when can I get home you see no no it was nobody’s fault it was my own decision actually yeah yeah yeah yeah I done the scene also with with uh with with with with Steve and all and and and Daniella and and the two girls and it was the scene where I told him I was going and I had to I had to be strong because I had to show no I'm this is what I'm going to do I'm doing it for Phil I'm no good to him I've lost him his kids I've lost grant I've lost you all yeah I'm going uh they all kept crying sobbing so I had to keep going to go over again and an actor I wanted to cry but I couldn't so what you have to do when you you mustn't cry is you you kind of hold that in and you just say don't be silly don't be silly now I'll be all right I'll be all right you don't know I'm doing that and they'll go just unbelievable those scenes they were they were unbelievable no because my because my mother and father were terribly different mummy wanted to get out the east end whatever and daddy didn't daddy still wanted to be in the east end you see I think they one of those things they fancied each other gutless at the beginning and then when it wore off I don't like you they didn't like each other he was a very good looking man my father and my mother was lovely and she had this gorgeous thick red hair and I had nine ears and a nit and no just like your father do you look at your hair she's like your father was a big disappointment okay but daddy no no never it's only after she died and I if I bumped into someone and and uh they'd say oh you're Rosie oh Rosie she was so proud of you but she would never tell me she'd say why did I take you away from the convent because I was in a convent I I went to a convent when I was between 10 and 13 and she said why why why didn't you become the foreign language telephony that I wanted you to be my mother never told me she loved me it wasn't until I I I but I love my mum very very much but we never got really never got on much because I was like my dad I had the laugh of my dad I looked like my dad and I think that she always saw my dad in me and then this terrible terrible divorce came when I was 13 and I was a young 13 a very extremely young 13 and um and I remember I had to go into court and uh and I had to write things he'd said to mummy and I and he was sitting there and I felt I was being unfaithful to him when I was awarded to my mother for five shillings a week she said don't worry darling daddy will still come and pick you up take you to the cinema still take you to dentists and he walked I remember he had this terrible yellow sweater on and he had um uh tacks on his heels so you you could hear him and I heard him walking down and I saw him and he walked straight past me and and that was it and then I used to stand at the the in Stoke Newington um outside Abney Park cemetery because he was a bus conductor hoping I see him you know saying please and I did see him once and he ignored me so I I I didn't understand that never heard from him again and then I get these letters from people who looked after him and said oh he was so proud of you he was yeah yeah oh yeah my mother yeah isn't it funny isn’t that strange no I know but I get that love in the theatre you see they're great when I was 14 I went in that show Love From Judy and I came out and everyone was clapping me god that's good I stand in line this is not like this I embrace it very very much but I do like now I’d rather talk to me milkman I mean or my postman than I would to some actors I do that's what upset my mum she came to stay with me one day and I got a house because of her I cannot believe my my daughter's a film star and she's she's famous and she lives in a flat I said okay so I finally got the house so she came to the house she stayed two weeks when she left I said mummy it's been lovely having you here I’d I thought I'd cook all the things that she wanted try to do everything that I knew the sandwiches had to be cut and forged you know she was snobbed snobby enough I said I said thank you for it it's lovely having you I hope your come again she said no I won't she don't think for one moment Babs that I've enjoyed it because I haven't so I said why she said well you put your dressing on you stand talking to your milkman not content with that you stand talking to the postman you're yelling out to people and you're dressing it I as it but I said that's the way I am mom yeah sure you're right my mother said the day Ronnie knight got out the car she went oh she died all over again because he was suited and booted very much and I think that's was my passion for Ronnie because he reminded me of my dad very much but uh no well I know he’d been been you know because he he he went into prison while I I was going out with him and I'd made arrangements and he never turned up and I remember phoning a friend and saying where is he they said oh he got 15 months I said what for they’d say back of a lorry I said what's the back of a lorry so everything these things that's what started it you know but I I but I thought well he won't now he's with me he won't won't be like that and I’d never been to a prison I remember going to see him at Wandsworth and I I I just couldn't believe it I I remember saying you don't want this so I said I tell you what I'll I’ll get a flat I'll leave my my family and I'll get a flat and this was all in my 21s and then and what happened was in that time he went and then I got Things Ain’t What They Used To Be and my life changed from being a working actress which I I thought that's that suits me I suddenly had my name up there no never never he came out and he bought the great A&R club which was a fabulous club in in in Charing Cross Road and I thought great this is it well next the next thing I know they came charging in the house five o'clock in the morning and it was to do with uh murder the murder of the the guy who shot his young brother no he swore to god on all everybody's lives like they do my mother's life you're like no no no I didn't do it I didn't I had nothing to do with it so it wasn't until many many years later when he did a book he said I hired someone so that was a horrible thing for me to find out that was a real you know after he'd sworn he didn't you know  no I mean now let me tell you Charlie wasn't like that it was a great great friendship and he wasn't one of those he just thought I was lovely and he would take me out that's what Charlie was like he was you know but that thing with Reggie
