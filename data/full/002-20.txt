I feel the same way you do I really don't have a favourite right it really is yeah yeah well I got a favourite they're my children I'm not gonna tell you it is though yeah they were I was uh I think I was very fortunate in the in the fact that um I was like the se- I'm a seventh son of eight boys and four girls and uh yeah it must be well I think I'm very lucky well somebody said dad should have a knighthood and mother said I bought him one but he won't wear it eh eh eh that’s a ding slapper at home they call it ding slapper but I think I'm fortunate by the time I came along the only part left to sing cuz they all sang you know and you go to Church of Christ mother went every Sunday you know and we were all breastfed so we was in church with Mama and I grew up listening to the singing and no estimates just singing and um you know like six to seventh part was the only one that was left right I had to sing harmony literally growing up I didn't know what lead was till I got out on my own you know so I think I was very fortunate to get to do that yeah I did the Las Vegas with Elvis on Rick Nelson I was I went to um I pla- I played on Rick's sessions and sang harmony with him on a lot of stuff uh-huh I could read I got to work to read the chord charts you know and and count the time but I couldn't read notes um at all uh one of them did and and I can't think it was Don the son of he said you don't read notes I was doing a Steve and Edie um country album well Steve and Edie does favourite country songs and he said you don't read notes I said no he said do you know the song I said Johnny said well this is just the lead so I played it I played the lead and played harmony with it on the intro and after this he was listening to the playback and he he could look on me smile and from that day on Don every time he would write me a a chart it would have solo Glen and he wouldn't have any notes in it and that made me feel good I think what made me most comfortable was uh Don Costa God rest his soul what a great musician but what made me most comfortable the guys that I was working with uh when I started doing my sessions were the same guys that I would I had been working with for like five or six years all the great session man you know Tommy Tadesco Hal Blaine drums Carol Kaye played bass on some of the stuff a Bill bass player it was mainly the guys that I had worked with Tommy Tadesco I never forget when I did True Grit on the Academy Awards here's Tommy Tadesco down in in the pit with the orchestra you know and he said he looked up and Tommy must have gained a hundred pounds since the session days since I and he looked up and said just think had I lost 200 pounds I could have been up there singing yeah but it's always they’re great guys um the commandery with musicians is the same as with golfer with football players with baseball players it's just a there's a click there yes oh definitely well um Elvis he would sit around the um he had this this tan- the the quartet Stamps Quartet was in the in the studio was Ann Margaret was sitting over there this must have been 1964 five when I was doing this and a they’d sit around the piano sing gospel music for hours it was a great date you know and we were getting what 60 bucks a session then you know for three hour session and we were there for 12 hours or something like that and frank we had ran strangers in the night for um at least an hour Bernie Freeman Bernie Bernie did the arrangement and I was sitting there playing my guitar well but Sam Frank got there I knew the song I could play it in my sleep cuz we had run it so much I was the end guitar player Sinatra was right there four feet away from me singing it live well I just played you know strangers in the night you know  it's an e-flat I was just had my capo on plan open ring in twelve string guitar chords and I I'd this look at Frank well every time he'd look over at me well I'd go right back to the paper like I knew what I was doing you know and then I look back at Frank cuz I was just digging him singing you know he went in and asked told asked Jimmy Bowen was producing today Jimmy Bowen is my producer now at camera record and he went into Jimmy said who is that fag guitar player sitting on the end over there just kill me that's what I'm a fan he said it wrong I'm a fan it is the most played Gentle On My Mind I'm still is um the second most played song of all time on radio Jimmy Webb about when I found Jimmy Webb I found my poet my musical poet I think Jimmy Webb's the best musical port that um God ever let over us he’s just I don't think um um I did too good a job of it as I look back on it but then again you know it's it's like walking the first time you know um you don't just get up and walk it happened overnight literally overnight cause you know the Summer Brothers Mother show you go on Sunday night network television uh and um it was in a it was in a number one time slot or close to it and we w- we won the ratings for six weeks in a row in the summer you know you got fifty forty five fifty million people a week watching it and after the third week everywhere I would turn hey Glen baby how are you and hey and it was n- real new to me real strange the privacy went that quick everything when it wants to seem like but the money didn't go I meant the money was good there that's right it sure did I guess it comes with some people don't held- handle success as well as others that's it probably so I don't know it seemed like it had it had an effect on my on my ex-wife it had an effect on my whole life at that time I think uh but I tell you Tommy Smothers I think is probably the best television producer I've ever worked for I met her I've ever seen literally I mean he just knew what to put together because the writing as you know writers make a show you know if you can't you ain't got nothing to say no then you have you got nothing to say but the writers the genius minds they come up with it um Tommy father smothers put together a Steve Martin a Rob Reiner uh Bob Einstein and Albert Brooks Bob’s brother worked on the show some too right and I ask I ask I ask Bob I said  why'd he change his name he said well Albert Einstein who to believe that and um McLean Stevenson Stiller and Meara Allen Bly was um it was a great guy on the show and as long as that team was there boy the show's would just click click click well my ear the ear was you know here I here was a guy with short hair having hit records and uh you know I was I was something different than what um supposedly the long hair is worth that time the marriage did uh I think it was from being on the road so much no I didn’t marry Tonya oh well we were engaged yes that’s very true I see I saw her and the baby and her mother back at the CMA Awards this year oh yeah I am you know I don't hold any grudges that's right that's exactly right you don't know y- when you yea know you're forgiven when you forgive somebody and that's the only way you can know if you hold grudges Oh boy it'll eat you alive I know people that go through life doing that you know they're always angry with the world but uh when you forgive somebody for something at light it takes a big load off of your shoulders and uh I think I think Jesus Christ that you know he's given me the wisdom to know how to forgive somebody Kim don't nag me she doesn't she don't she doesn't nag me she doesn’t say do this or do that you know yes she lets me be the captain of the ship you know the man's got to be responsible oh no I'm not talking about that I let her live her her life you know the Kim’s an executive shopper and she is a great mother to our three little kids we got she Cal I named one Nicholas Caledonia I really laid some names on him Jack Nicklaus is the first one Nic- Cat- Nicholas Caledonia and the other one is Shannon Webb well the Caledonia was the old name for for Scotland for the Celtic people it goes it dates a long way long long way back before that song and we were in I’d done a I’d done a festival in Cork Cork Ireland with um with um the Irish Band and Kim and I were at the airport and um Cal was with us he was just he was a little he was a baby then and she was pregnant again that's if it's a girl or boy let's name it Shannon because I just love that name and it was a boy so we named him Shanon it’s H A N O N yeah the girl’s spelled with two Ns yes I was uh um I was really it was like a dream I kept thinking you know I'm gonna wake up any minute now you know and just I'll be asleep and I've dreamed all this riding on a horse alongside John Wayne and I got uh but I figured Duke knew how to handle all of that see you know working with a nobody who’s never acted before oh Hathaway yeah it really was he’s told John Wayne don't you try to sing and Glenn don't you try to act I don't know what it was oh I thought I think that was something that uh that uh a critic said it but Hathaway was he would holler and oh this moan and groan I mean it was wonderful no I really I mean after I learned what it was yeah I did enjoy it after a while oh sure he wasn't that mean it was just front you know it's just like dogs barking if they badge and don't bark then you know they're real mean but Hathaway was I finally told him I said Henry I said you know I could be in Des Moines tonight you know probably make it more money I could make on this movie right now and I said so leave me alone I'm gonna leave then Robert Duvall came on the movie and oh you talk about you've seen in the movies two guys nose to nose hell if I tell you I was wonderful they were that way for about 10 minutes and Duke looked over at me and he said boy that boys got spunk don’t he I said sure could you know I thought you know I'd of course but I don't think Bob would hit here but they I'm telling you it was a funniest thing I wish they'd have kept that film boy that would have been a major film clip of all time after say bob say tennis now I'd go over there and I talked to Bob seemed like he was the one I kind of hung on to I was always in all John Wayne and but Bob is really a great guy and he told me a few little key things to do he said you know and I I noticed the change in me in the movie the moment I got some help yeah I'm Robert Duvall oh what a great actor I got three hundred dollars and four different banks now I don't know it's that's a lot of work you know that no I did it already I'll tell you how it worked Tommy Boat and I played Don Drysdale this was in 1969 for the lothropedicts and uh for the deaf children in Wichita Kansas and you know that goes Wichita Lineman was out here and um it was number one pop rock and and MOR something like this all three charts and um we beat him one up two up at 17 we beat Arnold Palmer and Don Drysdale so I didn't beat Arnold Palmer I knew uh what an idol I love oh yeah I just bend everybody's ear I've stopped doing that though oh I've I'd probably quit playing golf I I I doubt if I could ever beat Arnold head on oh you already seen him did you see him in a senior’s skin's game oh it's something I didn't know you had it my dad always said whip light and drive slow pay cash or don't go that’s a pretty good one I don't know what all that meant about whip light but all he ever drove was a wagon and team is probably why he said that you know don't beat the horses but uh treat the other daddy always told me son treat the other fella as you want to be treated you'd like to be treated so that really is a my philosophy of life and to try to do some good I like the song I did it on an album called I Will Pass This Way But Once I wanted I want to do an album like I cut one an album last year that I thought was just I got I’ve lis- I've listened to it more than anything ever recorded it's called Favorite Hymns featuring Tall Oak Tree and it was a total how about that for timing but it I've played it more than anything I’ve recorded called Favourite Hymns featuring Tall Oak Tree it's on Canaan Records oh I sure definitely we’ve only scratched the surface I sure did is that something I look like I'm really playing I'm dude on I just I just must be in the blood I'm my ancestors goods Campbell's of our goals definitely Scottish all Gaelic names I love it
