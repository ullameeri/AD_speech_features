I think God has really put my footsteps in the right place at the right time and I put them in the wrong place at the wrong time I get paid for tracking and I get paid for singing so consequently it was a very lucrative ah thing for me at the time you know I was able to buy a little house up in Sacramento Valley oh I mean I was high in cotton man top leaf as to say eh eh eh my favourite music I think Pet Sounds the Beach Boys Pet Sounds album and I think that was just an awesome album that was my first sexual encounter I guess you can call it and you know it was just something that we fell into you know and she got pregnant we had a son but he only he only survived about four five days and ah but the most wonderful thing everything happens for a reason eh I have a daughter after that marriage Debby and she’s I couldn’t ask for a better human being on this earth I could I could monkey see monkey do type of thing you know and ah that’s all I ever wanted that’s all I ever wanted to do when I realised I could play a guitar when I when dad got me the guitar I figured out a way to get a rubber band and put a stick across it and tighten it down so I could play in any key because you get above G I couldn’t match the strings down because they were about that high off the neck you know eh eh I took her home one night she’d come out with a girl named Nancy I should’ve married Nancy eh eh well no I was actually I shouldn’t have done anything anyway we got married we had three kids what a good chord progression Wichita Lineman was the um most played song of all time on radio what a song what a song yeah ah that’s me I don’t like labels I’m a I’m a musician and I’m a singer I can sing any kind of song and I can play any kind of song ah and I can play any kind of style well it seemed like it then scotch was my choice of but ah I just didn’t have any songs to cut I was too I was I was I was on the road uh my ex-manager had me on the road literally all the time during that period after the TV show went off seventy one it was it was that and the alcohol the whole thing is it almost got too much for me people wanted a piece of you here piece of you there and uh it got so busy to where I couldn’t find good songs to do I was indulgent in alcohol too much I’ll put it that way I couldn’t handle it I’m I’m too susceptible to it it was 17500 square feet of uh rambling it took me two days to find out where everything was and I noticed a big change in our after the house was being built after the house was built and um seemed like she became the focal point she wanted to be the focal point and she had people over there I didn’t even know for parties at the house and stuff it took me three months to learn how to do that it was like patting your head and rubbing your stomach it wasn’t it wasn’t a good thing to do but god ah you see I I was working under I was under a microscope it didn’t matter where I went or what I did you know that Mac honestly just didn’t bother me any I was I was doing what I wanted to do I thought I was helping somebody I’ll put it that way when the scotch wouldn’t do it then I started taking drugs you know I didn’t I had never heard of cocaine until my um my ex-wife introduced me to it that was something that acted a little quicker than alcohol so I got into that if I yeah when I got mad I was I was mean and I said boy you were going downhill and no breaks um my personal life was going right uh to hell in a handbag or how about in a wheelbarrow that’s why that’s why that weren’t around that long I really thought I thought Tanya was a fabulous talent you know but um when I found out the kind of like lifestyle she liked to live that uh boy we’re talking about some arguments she’s a liar she’s lying knocked her teeth out wow she was just you know she was so different than what I’d been through you know and I just know that Kim I felt that was the one that uh because she never gave me any any grief and she still doesn’t and when she does she doesn’t make up anything she tells me just like it is I didn’t I didn’t stop the whiskey I stopped taking drugs I stopped taking it was gone out of my life but I got into the bottle I’d prayed prayed about it and uh all of a sudden the cigarettes were gone the whisky’s gone it was just bet surely got delivered and it it was a very very um it wasn’t me that did it uh God just took all of that away I’v asked people you know to forgive me for the for the way that I was I’m sorry you know and I’ll probably never do that again I think that’s the greatest thing you know and the bible if there is forgiveness for sins ah and god has forgiven me I know a lot of people that hasn’t forgiven me um well it I did um a special for like VH1 I think it was um and um maybe that had something to do with it but the the people that saw the shows so the people that saw the show you know like um Sher Nio Dieman and myself Ella Fitzgerald and you know Lender Ronstad um Roy Rogers and then one we had Johnny Cash and you know oh I did and all I had to do was say hi I’m Glen Campbell and say it because the writers were just totally off off the walls yeah one’s aired already and um they’re gonna air them every week yes I’m working too much um actually well we’re going out with Andy Williams again and Brandson and um it’s really fabulous show we get we’re going out it April we start April 19th through um we’re gonna go up early though to tape something through the Geril List Harrow Fund so April 19th through June and then we go back in on the 7th of October um September through October and um I gotta go out and do like 45 minutes or something and then and then Andy does and then I guess it’s the same with Andy I mean it’s just a hoot I mean I don’t know eh eh eh I re- thir- to twenty thirty something I think thir- yes yes charted the very first big one um I had was turn around look at me I was I’d been out on the road with the Champs and also I played I played on limbo rock you remember one of those running under the stick routine that were I that was a pretty big step yeah and when I when I went out on the road with Danny and the juniors and Jack Scott there was a big tour in I think 61 and then I had a hit ah with a a Turn Around Look at Me in 1962 yeah I was always a singer oh yeah I did get to work with him on a record I got to play on Strangers in the Night you know I was both of those no eh eh eh I if I’m I sit around and play guitar more than I sit around and sing I’ll put it that way so yeah I am I love singing I just love well Turn Around Look At Me I wrote half of it and um but I could um go there is someone who really needs you here’s my heart and my hand the and Jerry K part um but I did I I could make more money and and stoun doing sessions than I could on the road I rem- I remember going in out before The Doors and um yes try going around and you know what I’m saying Turn Around Look At Me in in and I had to do like twenty minutes you know and I did Turn Around Look At Me first so I then know where I was cause the regural was pretty big hit out there and then The Doors come out and we played that we played that in a um in um Oregan and um and um Washington and um oh they were incredible they were eh eh I’d never seen anything like that on stage they were like you know everything from he was he had incredible charisma yeah I mean you could you could sit he he could walk in a room you know and you could feel like he’s one of those guys like Elvis exactly the whole shooting mash but I liked to stay there and do that stuudio work cause I could make more money doing that Brian in 1965 took we’re off of the road Brian Wilson  and the Beach Boys and he said it only took him two years to write Pet Sounds and then that meantime I went out on the road with the Beach Boys played base singed the high parts which was wild yes oh and it was fun dude yeah after having the hit record and I had a couple of albums out three or four albums out but I did I like I really enjoyed being in the studio and and working like you know with like Quincy Jones and the Heat of The Night you know I wrote and um Rach Harold oh oh yeah God gave me a gift to play and sing he really did no never took I’ve been singing and playing the guitar ever since I can remember down in Arkansas um well I I said it you know how you say something in a certain way and a guy who is writing it doesn’t say it the way you said it I’ll put it that way just to actually just to get it all out and say this is what happened you know and um yeah I did oh yeah yes it did in fact it well and Bill Bill Clinton helped me a lot cause I I quit smoking also cause um I’d heard Bill I didn’t know until about twelve years ago that people marking so didn’t inhale so I said why smoke you know so I quit smoking yeah that would have that would have I’d still use it too on on the shows but um to to be clean and go out and and play and sing I’m I’m really enjoying it I I wouldn’t I wouldn’t say madly in love I’d say it was it was she was she was there at the time that when Sarah and I broke up so that was um it’s just one of those things that happened and it was it was we were we were definitely not made for each other alright I know that I mean Tanya’s you know we were she’s a great singer she’s a great person still on stage but we just it just didn’t work you know well you know how that is oh yeah I got mad at them sometimes you know I didn’t say anything though they said just you know yeah yeah ve- vengeance’s mine says the lord I remember that from when I was a kid and I said whatever happens will happen I don’t I won’t be a part of it no I haven't talked to her in fifteen seventeen years eighteen yeah no I I I I saw her in I don't even I don't remember eh eh eh ah well I I turned to god and said uh you know I can't do it by myself I need some help yeah it was all of those yeah yeah and I'm a cheap drunk you know and I'm a I'm a cheap high I'll put it that way and I I could not be around marijuana I've I I could walk in a room for somebody that's been smoking and I would it would it would immediately affect me because I guess that's the way my metabolism is same way with alcohol I I you know I'm a guy that definitely cannot hold his liquor you know I can I can take a shot of whisky and be on pretty good bounce yeah I guess my probably what it was you got me I never I never drank when I was a kid because if we did you know daddy would wear the back of out of your pants out but I remember I didn't drink for a long time because I got I got in an old home brew jug you know tell me by the spring and it wasn't done yet and I drank about a couple of glasses of that yea I thought I was gonna die for two days you know it was the home brew it was the old the old yellow stuff and it really like as you said broke you from sucking eggs we had dogs that get in the nest and dad would open up a little bitty hole in the egg and he'll put real hot sauce in it the dog would get one one an never go in that hen house again and that's the way I was about I was off it yeah yes but I got into the drinking scotch and soda and it I I mean like I said I would I'm a cheap drunk so I s- I was pretty well loaded most of a lot of the most of the time during that whole period not drunk oh yeah I'd go on stage yes with cocaine with um oh yeah Roger Miller said I remember the words and the lyrics too both of those it was I don't know I I you know when the everything broke up I guess I was just trying to run away from things you know and they just actually not living the real world you know and it was boy I don't know I don't I just think that ah that ah that he got me through all of that mkm I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and I yes mum went to church every Sunday and you'd drug all the kids and ah yes actually it was I just woke up said I can I can quit this I know I can and I like I said I prayed and I prayed and uh cigarettes went I stopped smoking and uh the liquor came later and ah like all within a span of three or four weeks I did it I I clean cut everything it was amazing cause I've I was awful as as long as I've been sober eh eh eh em em I don't know twelve years maybe no I would drink a glass of wine occasionally but you know you can you can get hung on that too oh yes definitely I've it's all behind me and um we actually um go to church on Saturday with the Messianic um yeah Jewish believers yeah well I'm not Jewish but I go to that congregation yes exactly and it's it's so different than going to um um a regular Sunday church you know because they celebrate it when there's Sabbath and it's the seventh day and um my wife and I and it's a lot of fun she's really into it we did a whole play on the b- on pyrom right no you know I it we we really don't you know we we bu- we burn the oh yes I go out yes I'm a better player a better singer yes an I in fact sounds like when smoking I I I put Hank Williams back in the show I can do I can do love sing blues and long gone lonesome blues and I could not do it when I was smoking well the voice you know and the the drinking too whiskey really dries out your system alcohol does anyway you know I didn't I did I don't know yeah right yeah and I would I would say mean things to people who hold it up in fact one of my lady come back one time that says you know you didn't and she was crying and said you don't have to say that to me because I told her to shut up you know and I said no I don't come over there and what I said was I don't come over there and jerk the mattress off Monday when you're working so leave me alone and I would say mean things like that on stage I would I I'm blessed and I I I I heard Rhinestone Cowboy on the radio I was coming out of the uh like uh uh the session in capital and I had the albums cut station on here in L.A and um Rhinestone Cowboy came on and it just I said that's that's me I have been walking these streets so long singing the same old song I said singing that's of course Larry Weiss it was it was an album cut station don't know which one it was but they know I'm sure they know um and I went and got it and and that was it I took it on a tour to Australia and I knew it backwards by the time I got and Al Gore who is head of capital then I went and played it for him said I got a song for you he said no I got I found one for you and he played me Rhinestone Cowboy same song and I said well I'll play you mine and then I put him on I had Rhinestone Cowboy and it was number one it was number one record of 1975 oh Carl is a wonderful guy Carl Carl really really helped me he helped me a lot he didn't know I was a JRP when I was a cowboy oh I loved Carl it was um kind of felt like fish out of water you know uh it was fabulous oh yeah well see he'd he had tried it almost everyone you know Fabian you know and um Frankie Avalange and his people he'd had them in a movie but he didn't have them giving him that push he needed so that's where I came in and eh eh eh I I always say that I made John Wayne look so good he won his only Oscar I pulled him through yeah that was um terrible time no no well I didn't know she told me they were done no and I was broke up uh and uh it just oh yeah definitely you can't you know you can't break up anything unless somebody wants you to yeah I talk to Mike I saw him out of um Dulver uh we say hi you know I don't know I'm uh I'm uh I'm gonna talk to him when I see him oh wow I was in Branson New Surrey with Andy working and that was um a boy just that was the most oh I was up but a I didn't I didn't see it the first time I I mean I'd see that I saw the I saw that was on the news I think that's the worst thing that's probably ever happened to this um on this Earth I saw it on TV and I said I I I was just torture yeah and then I was watching when the when the first when the first building came down and that was just yes Andy's and I performed and I said and for some reason I did God Bless the USA at the end of the show and it was just all it was just everybody was in tears yeah I'm almost in tears now yes it was really really difficult but Andy said people have come they know what's happened they've seen it on the news all day and I said whatever you wanna do Andy is fine with me and so just we went ahead and did the show yeah oh he's a singer well he can sing anything and you know and I god gave blessed me with a voice to sing anything with him it's it's Andy and I have he's got such a great range and we thing and he's still got it the boy's still got it I mean that's why he wanted somebody to come in with him you know to have to have share the load a little bit cause he was doing two hours by himself and doing all the sketches and running and you know and he's you know he was like in his late sixties and he he just can't do that and I told him I said I was wondering when he's gonna get somebody to do this show for you anyway and when he asked me to I said yes I I would love to do that because I really love singing with Andy cause we grew up the same way uh you know youngest in the family of singers and you had to sing every part you know so Andy and I were just such a natural for us to do the harmony stuff we do a Ziggy Medley you know it's there because hey you did a lot of Ziggi's songs and we you know we'd do all the singing right mind but we did all the you know like um Chadanuva Chud um you know um going to Kansas City um all that and man I'll take Manhattan and we just do all Ziggy songs and a Medley and it's just wonderful yes I was I was a dear friend of Elvis you see Elvis really liked me oh he did he said Glen you're really a you're my friend now no I didn't know no I I I I didn't and I still don't know what it was that that that killed him um in my own mind I don't but when I was driving through the Doni Marie show and somebody said you hear Elvis died and I just instantly broke up I just couldn't believe I had to by pull around at the corner at the channel five and then just sat there and cried cause I really really loved Elvis Presley he was such a um nice human being because never heard a bad thing about Elvis Presley he was nice I I got to play on Viva Las Vegas soundtrack and stuff like that cause yeah I met him in 56 he came to with a Ferrel Young Show and um in Albuquerque he was supposedly opening for the Ferrel Young Show and um Ferrel made the mistake of having of Elvis opening the show the first night in Armarella on the tour when they got to Albuquerque Ferrel went out and did his show and then introduced his special guest it was the most awesome thing I'd ever seen in my life of just he and the three guys was better than I've ever seen anybody I got to see Johnny Cash with just Johnny and the Tennessee Two buy he had three right or rhythm guitar I went in in 1970 with Meryl Hagger and did um Caroline with him sing harmony with him cause I did all the harmony back can't singing with Meryl before I and Meryl asked wanted me to do it when he did the TV show uh well I think the down the downside was what it did to um Billy and the kids you know uh I just I was making good money as a studio musician but uh I think the fame and uh uh and everything I think that would be the downside of it that it everything I wasn't treated the same way and I didn't like that that much you know I um but most of the people that I knew did but I was I wasn't just I couldn't walk down the street you know everybody was and that was a shock yes but I'll take success over failure
