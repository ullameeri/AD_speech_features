I saw that I thought you did very well yeah no surely not yes we kind of glanced off one another there that’s such a huge production you have no idea on just looking at it on on the screen it’s it’s like a an amphibious landing back stage with neon lights beard quite often I have un- undoubtably worn more beards than any other living actor that’s um Richard Luo now here’s a interesting thing cause about half of those beards are real beards that I grew and half are fake that one what would you say you guess yeah that’s right that that was designed by Ziggy Khaki who is the best beard maker well except that’s a it’s a that kind of beard and I’ve got a fake nose on too that’s a fake nose that’s not my nose one of the things I liked about playing Rich Luo he’s the only historical character I play with a bigger nose than I have so that’s right you’re getting very good yeah I grew that one yeah no that chest hear that when I played Moses uh they had to shave down and I don’t know why but they did that’s the film I made last summer I’ll be back here in July talking about it when it comes out it’s called Mountain Men well that’s also one of Ziggy’s beards it’s a that’s a fake beard and um very good one yeah that’s a good job that’s one of my wife’s photographs by the way she’s very good indeed that’s from a film that’s yet to be released that’s a film gonna be out in the fall called the Awakening there you go no last summer yeah but see the vote was real and that’s the we saw one yeah yeah they played it at Easter time actually I wore nine different beards in that um film the first one was my own was just a stubble on the brick bits and then when I was throwing the tablets around I it’s nine different beards and um got into false noses and false eye bags and all kinds of stuff oh gosh spirit gum when I was studying make-up at Northwestern I thought the smell of spirit gum you know it’s some kind of adhesive dissolved in ether I thought it was the most exciting smell in the world now I’ve used up about five gallons of it and I’m gonna tell you you sit up in this snow in the grand tea tons at five o’clock in the morning in the make-up man comes to you okay but you know I’ve gone through so much of it you bet I think that’s what turns us all on the smell of yeah that’s right and that’s what it’s all about you’re somebody else that’s right oh that’s why if I have time to grow my own beard unfortunately it takes me about seven weeks there are guys who grow faster beards than I do yeah that’s right that was for Michelangelo I mean I can need the ecstasy I had a fake nose in that Michelangelo’s nose was more broken than mine you can’t quite see it in that shot but um they put a little plastic noodle in my nose so it kind of went over like this and uh well if they’re paste on beards you gotta play those scenes very carefully if they’re real beards I thin uh I think ladies like them it helps when I’ve grown my own beards I know my wife likes it and my daughter likes it and that’s my uh firm parameter I have a theory about beards I think uh if you start to think of it um growing a beard is one of the few things men can do that women don’t wanna do right they got really no interest in that it’s our last retreat she usually does especially um as a photographer she uh finds it uh uh stimulating way to find things to shoot although she she sometimes as uh the Mountain Men did some of the stills for the pictures but she’s really more interested in photographing um what she finds behind the cameras pointing the other direction and of course yes indeed she is uh I don’t have anything opening for a couple of months and um we’ll be back to talk about that I hope then but uh Lydia has another photo exhibit opening on Sunday at the Green House which is across from the Goudingy Art Museum and the opening day we’re gonna have a brunch for the benefit of the Red Knight As Pigmandose foundation and all the proceeds from the pictures she sells she’s gonna give to them too no she was an actress then and was an actress did um several films and a number of plays actually succeeded starred on Bradway before I did um but after our son was born why she became less interested in acting and what then was a hobby um photography now has become a full fledged career and she’s having exhibits all over and uh gotten to be a very exciting thin and I’m very proud of her she’s a she’s a classy lady and a gifted photographer cold water flat um outnumbered by about 5000 cockroaches in the house kitchen and um Lydia was supporting me then and by modelling and then um actually I had a brief career as a model I was a a nude model at the art students league in the um the life studies classes we never talked about that is it okay to talk about that people don’t get angry do they yeah no it’s a decent living that’s right well actually at the time you got a dollar fifty in hour uh and you got a a a coffee and tea break every fifty minutes and so the cookies um they gave you cookies too and that counted in those days and uh actually I say nude model then uh there was discrimination the women modelled nude the men you had to wear a little jockstraps and my Lydia made me a little velour jockstrap it was kinda cute I wish I still had it I I could have competed with I’ve never made a movie or done a play it’s easier to tell with a movie cause you can see it afterwards the play you’re at the middle of never done a film that I was completely happy with I never done a one I’d like to do all over cause I could do it better uh and I think that as you say that’s okay that’s what it’s supposed to be it’s supposed to please an audience not the people who make it you’re supposed to people say wasn’t it fun working with Whyler no it wasn’t fun working with Whyler it was very tough to work with uh and you’re doing something I I know you well enough I know you have this attitude towards what you do you’re never completely satisfied but on the other hand that’s what makes it satisfying for a lifetime that’s how you can keep doing it cause you say I’m gonna get it right one of these days horses are prettier oh of course they are horses are bloody stupid animals Ed believe me you’ve gotta believe me I’ve made a lot of money living on them and um they’re who I don’t know who was said it but it’s certainly true that three most beautiful things in the world are a sleeping baby a naked woman and a running horse that’s certainly true I said nice line yeah running naked woman asleep I’ve been around pigs pigs are pretty smart as I said they’re not prettier but boy they’re smarter the problem with a horse is not only is he stupid but they’re very strong and they can hurt you from both ends it’s something to think about that I’ll give you one thing though or give Ed one thing I don’t wanna have you um the only animal um that is now horses are not mean see they’re just dumb but the camel now let me talk to you bro I’ve made three pictures with camels and I don’t care if I nev- never get within a hundred feet of a camel again they spit they smell bad they bite even when you are on them they can reach around and bite you on the knee and do and also they complain you know they gotta sit down for you to get on them and then they get up like this and they complain the whole time they go oh Johnny it’s lovely to come it it feels I guess I’ve been coming by here so long that it feels like I’m dropping it to an old friend’s front room
