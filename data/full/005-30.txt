he was in no class that had more than 20 when he started and now as I said he is several than it 2004 by modern standards that's considered a small class I talked to uh the teacher who's teaching Fraser's uh Shakespeare class and he taught last year in Beverly Hills public high school which mind you is supposed to be once was considered a model of public high school and he said god what a relief to get to a school where the kids aren't standing in the back standing room in some places and split days you know double-shift days it's no wonder none of the kids are coming out of public high schools within a reasonable education you mean te- television electronic uh well teaching aids they have some very sophisticated teaching aids uh including I suppose teaching machines but I I don't think it uh you know again it's a stopgap solution the problem will just keep increasing on it your solution does not apply itself to the problem really and it applies itself to a symptom you know it's like if a fella has smallpox you say look we can use makeup and cover those spots yeah oh somewhere we can cover all these up and get them all covered up you know stuff that smallpox no because you know what that's a to me an excellent case in point I thought the problem with that film it was so bloody sure you know they were lecturing at one another and everybody in the film was so concerned about it if they'd all been really that concerned they never would have gotten in that situation you know uh and nobody's seen and and yet curiously enough they all seem to have quite nice clothes and uh live in the interiors all looked quite nice to me and uh we were determined to make a film that was not a an animated lecture and one of the ways that we did we I hope are arriving at this is that the characters in the picture are unaware of the desperateness of their situation by and large uh just as you've probably read you know the human animal is remarkably adaptable yes you know the uh you perhaps read and children born in uh during the war in concentration camps weren't desperately unhappy in the camps you know I mean that's just the way life was and that's the way you lived and you lived on beetroot soup and uh the odd potato and the people that live in the in the streets and sleep in abandoned cars and who make a living pulling with ropes uh empty truck bodies around full of stuff or on pedicabs they don't uh spend their time bemoaning their faith they just live it's not a very good uh again the quality of life is not marvellously enhanced but they don't complain of it there the character I play uh I can't remember if we spoke of this before or not but I share this tiny apartment with an old man and he can remember how it was and he says you know you used to be able to get meat in the stores you get the lettuce you could buy eggs in any store anything I say yeah I know you told me that all the time you know and meantime I'm shaving with a razor blade that then you have to put in your wallet because someone will steal your razor blade if you know and shaving in cold water and you know it dribbled into a tin cup because you got to carry the water up from the street you know and but you'd go on and talk about your job and other things and the so you have a a life that is better than in my case the case of my character better than the millions of people out in the street I've heard the word uh for example uh my my boss the captain of detectives chief of detectives in this precinct he's asking me about a girl that I've been questioning uh and he says what about her and I say like grapefruit and he says you never saw a grapefruit and I say yeah you never saw her you know probably I never did see a grapefruit but I've heard the word I know what a grapefruit is supposed to look like well of course their life you know you don't have many problems if your life is reduced to a a place to sleep and getting your water ration and your food ration that really occupies all your time you have no job anyway there's nothing to spend money on except a few broken-down plastic cups like they're selling in that street market set we have out there yes now I play a desperately overworked detective who has a problem because I have a certain sense of responsibility uh to my job uh detectives are overworked today they're not able to put the time on cases caseloads they have uh I talked to my superior in the story about a murder investigation he says well look you've been on that two days and I said well I'm just beginning to get somewhere and he says look there since then there have been 347 people killed in New York and we're not gonna solve any of those murders either so come I get over in this other one to forget it we're gonna close that case uh but you know you talk to two real cops now and they're desperately overworked and double shifted and uh don't have time to investigate properly and they let things slip and it's uh one of the problems of of a society and overcrowded society which we are seeing now I am deeply convinced the uh sudden uh upsurge of of casual violence I think is a result of overcrowding again you see this from the experiments they've conducted with rat populations in a f- in an inviting environment of fixed size in which let us say a hundred rats live comfortably and productively and have a fine time doing whatever it is rats do but if you increase the population in that colony to 200 or 500 and then a thousand the rats uh you can uh this is demonstrable has been demonstrated uh you find increasing incidence of anxiety and actually neurosis prone rats uh psychotic problems of various kinds uh increase in uh sexual knowledge adjustments of various kinds cannibalism rats eat their young or example on them casually and abandon them and what we speak of now and bemoan deplore as the alienation that you see increasingly among people uh the professor at Columbia University who was killed on the street by muggers and people were watching who didn't do anything the a uh a few years ago the you go you I guess you could even call it the Kitty Genovese II syndrome where this woman Kitty Genovese II was killed in the parking lot of an apartment building in a courtyard and it took 25 minutes to kill her and she was running around hiding uh behind the cars while these young muggers were chasing her with knives and she's screaming and people are leaning out their windows watching and didn't do anything didn't even call the police this is uh this is alienation and we find that in the story enormously increased the character I play is an alienated man he has uh through most of the story very little capacity to empathize with the problems of other people as you or I would but again these aren't these are things that we try to deal with peripherally nobody comments on it in the story he's going into a church to a question of priests on a case and on the steps of the church he sees a woman lying dead and a baby is tied to her with a rope and the baby's crying of course and he checks sees the woman's dead and he fixed the kid up and puts it under his arm and hands it to someone in the church but with no expression of sympathy he does it as a pragmatic thing to do it part of his it started sort of street cleaning part of his job as a cop and he does it but he doesn't he there's not a flicker in sympathy in his face for the child he just does it as the thing that heâ€™s supposed to do but uh it's uh I think the alienation of between individuals as I suppose as the physical crowding becomes closer the capacity to to really feel any kind of relationship with a another human being becomes less possible if you and I are sitting like this on the couch we can think about one another's problems and if uh I say is that breeze too cold for you let me close the door or you know whatever or would you have a drink too but if there are 25 more people sitting on this couch each one of us is doesn't really finally give a damn about anybody else you know if they yeah if you could yeah you know to get room for he himself to breathe you know at any cost this is the kind of role that I have played from time to time it's what my wife calls my hero heal roles on the other hand I have perhaps played a higher proportion numerically of uh men like Sir Thomas Moore or Thomas Jefferson or the see uh who's uh I think a commoner more commonly discernible thread running through the parts I've played which is rather surprises me because in theory obviously well in fact an actor can only play a part that that exists I mean unlike a painter or a poet or a novelist he can't say gee this is what I want to do and do it you have to somebody in my case I can control the content of the pieces I do to a large extent but somebody has to be willing to make the film you know somebody has to say we alright we'll pay to make this film as Metro did in this case but nonetheless I would say fully two-thirds of the films I've made have to do with the problems of individual responsibility the responsible man this is above all one man for all seasons is about uh it's about it's the preoccupation of a man like Andrew Jackson whom I whom I've played twice uh it finally is the thread that made the seed historically as well as in legend one of the most remarkable men in the Middle Ages his capacity to be the responsible individual curiously enough individual responsibility is seems to mean a very unfashionable idea now I'm surprised I've been able to make a living making so many parts about such man uh Will Penny is a man whose only remarkable feature he's a very his an illiterate cowboy he is you know in no way distinguishable from just any other cowboy except his concept of himself as a responsible man he can't write his name but uh when he's up in the line camp and the winter snows and he goes out in adequately dressed and in adequately mounted to check the the cattle that he was not up there to Jack and the woman says but but it's it's a blizzard what if you didn't go who know and he says I would uh both the Shakespearean films I've done uh Antony and Cleopatra and Julius Caesar Antony's problems in the first he solves it uh in Julius Caesar his uh he succeeds in discharging his responsibilities in of course the tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra is the collapse of the inner core that is abandonment of his responsibilities perhaps the largest abandonment by one man on record of of the whole Roman Empire uh but you're quite right as my wife is remarked that many times such men are rather harsh men yes this this finally overthrowing but he was superbly equipped at least his well-equipped as Octavius Caesar to rule the Roman world uh perhaps only three or four men Hadrian uh Caesar and Augustus were in his league as as leaders uh he he hid the tragic flaw andAnthony of course is he is in capacity to resist his own pleasure to sublimate to render secondary his own pleasure one of the reasons that I chose to play Antony uh have played I played him in Julius Caesar four times in all two film versions once on television once on stage uh is that with all the great tragic roles the great Shakespearean roles they being each of them really so totally beyond the grasp of any actor they are larger than any actor I think especially as an American actor where are opportunities to play Shakespeare are more limited than that the American actor is well advised to choose those roles to which he can bring the most equipment to begin with obviously Anthony is such a role for me uh the other is Macbeth which I've played several times uh Hamlet is a part which in which I would have to be fighting myself all the time my whole well my size is against me in Hamlet for one thing it helps me in Macbeth or a fellow let us say or Antony but uh you you want someone rather more like as Gilbert was uh who's Hamlet I will never never forget in 37 when I was a kid that is what Hamlet should be like
