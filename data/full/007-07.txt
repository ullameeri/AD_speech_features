I don’t usually wear a flock I want to show the lollies again they're not bad actually are they’re quite straight yeah look look look look but I’ve got it’s such a I’ve become a bit like Peggy wearing trousers all the time with a jacket oh so I thought you know it is it’s quite good well actually I'm a bit nervous I don't know why  well I don't know because they told me I got to do all this whoever you know you know I I haven't seen it since my birthday is a disgrace my husband said would you say a few words on my 70th birthday the nice little party a few friends yeah it gets up he tells all these things you shouldn't say all the things things my old man don't know about yeah it was lovely thank you thank you oh and my Kenny oh I loved it I did I mean I didn’t particularly want a party because but it’s other people say but it’s your seventy oh you must Barbara this is very special so you know I got people near you know and a few family and that  was really nice I enjoy and I I chose a place where I could look at my beloved London I love London with a passion and you know it was lovely wasn't it it was very posh you could see over Kensington Gardens and all that yeah it was nice really nice I do I really love oh I really love it love it love it absolutely oh that's good but you know but I like most cities I love Liverpool I love that’s terrific yeah yeah yeah yeah we well we all do that I mean Ken Livingstone we all moan about in thanks God is dead so we can all moan about him in it I know she's got herself into a terrible situation no well what's happened is it's because she hasn't got a man I think that's what it is not that I'm asking for them to bring me a fellow in because I'm too old for all that all that friends and teeth and and I don’t wanna know and people let's face it don't want to see 70-year-olds kissing they really leave that to the young people but I think it's because she hasn't got someone organizing her life and she's not very good with money she never has been and of course she paid for the wedding for Phil that was her present to him she had the the Vic done up not that it noticed not a blind bit different is it they oh we're going to do this and I walked out is that it no don’t don’t is that it no that was it you know no I I I thought it was going to be white and cream and lovely but I suppose they wanted to keep the original uh so there was that and then she went on that cruise spent too much money bought herself a little diamond which I've forgotten to wear recently because you you get these storylines it's all about and like we've got a dog where's the dog I haven’t seen it for three weeks I keep going I keep saying uh uh shut the door kick the dog in the kitchen you know so that’s what I mean and you forget so she did all these things and she got herself into a bit of a set of course Phil's drinking isn't he and she doesn't want to worry and being pressured to bear and haven't got grant I mean he comes in and out when he feels like it you know when he's not doing those gang things and the worst of it yeah so there we go so she's got herself into a this stae and um there's no one for her I mean the two girls have come in and and she doesn't really want to tell them because she likes to be proud she's very funny she's terrible gossip and she said you know little gossip but she doesn't like to air her is it laundry out you know dirty laundry washing out you know a bit like that so she's got herself into a state that's it I know well well we’ve brought back Anna Karen who played our Sal she played Olive in On The Buses do you remember what she'd come back but she's a nuisance she's a bloody nuisance she really is she really is and the other day I was watching she's a smoker and of course now you can't smoke in the pub and and and see what she doesn't want to do with their hands and I said what can't you pretend to smoke you know they've done that but no no she's great but she's no help well they brought her back into the show but I've got the two girls yeah they are I thought they uh when they said you know the family's a bit depleted so we we're going to bring some somebody in you know another Mitchell I thought what some illegitimate son that me first husband had so you know so I was really surprised when these two girls came in they were abs- and I've known Sam forever and and Rita who plays Roxy she's she's she's a singer in a band I mean she's really taken to it and I just think their typical Mitchell's and it's so nice to well it’s us against the guys in it it’s really really good they they’re my husband’s brothers my husband’s brothers so  what do they they’re my my nieces yes that’s right oh my god stop that last night they were gonna say alright auntie Peg gotta stop that no it's gotta be Peggy isn’t it you know I don’t we don’t like that so I should tell miss I don’t want that yea I know I know I know how'd you know that well it isn’t just cause I know most often it's been 13 years now on the show it's unbelievable isn't it yeah and of course I know most of the directors and so I know their Achilles heel see so no no never I love this business too much and I'm thrilled the girls are in and if I can help them out in any way that's fine well that what do we need you and I are very similar we're very alike we like it to be nice we like to be kind  don't we and then Gods give good to us no I can’t bear any of that I like there to be a great atmosphere and I have to say there is a magnificent atmosphere on EastEnders you know and uh and I think
