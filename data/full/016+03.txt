well she definitely came off the bench there I think it's in the third quarter maybe with about two minutes left or three and scored I think eight straight points and we were down four or five and then the next thing I knew we were up three because she of her scoring advantages she just has the potential I knew that inside and outside when she comes in the tempo new game changes our our up transition offense was much stronger um and then I thought you did really good job finishing the game forced defence well I just thought we got defensive stops when we needed to you know we really kind of rose to the occasion we've kind of known that sense that keep place they’re gonna learn crunch time and then I thought we we got some deep rebounds uh I thought we had a rebound there were coach called a timeout that should have been a timeout and non jump off but I hope we crunched on which I ran the end game play Jess Moore came in for us um and really did a good defensive job and disrupted the play and uh the wrong person took the shot same two keys we’re we’re we’re letting Tappy Phonderson and Penny Taylor get in our middle too much and then we’re giving up too many second chance points we cannot let them have 21 24 second chance points we need for it to be around 9 or 10
