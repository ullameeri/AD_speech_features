a man who’s got something caught between his legs right well that's what it’s been described when I was a teenager I was made fun of they thought that um you know I was walking on my toes which I’d do a kid I did walk on his toes but he bent his knuckles like that when he walked on his toes you know just walk I mean it doesn't I saw you describe somebody's walk the other night and you're all wrong yeah you said he walked like this but he doesn’t he walks like this no they’re closer to his body I watched them walk out all the scenes he and I had together in the great escape room in a tunnel you know very close the tunnel was so bloody small I get feelings of claustrophobia I used to work in a coal mine and get it panic every day and uh being in that tunnel it brought it all back you see so it was very easy for me to do the scene my father was a coal miner all my brothers were coal miners including myself and I resent Winston having problems with coal miners and whales well they did they did everybody has problems with coal miners they're on strike when we were in a war if you remember national defence anyhow just before the war began I was involved in it I know oh i wasn't the only one there was some miners who would bite rails they were so angry you know yeah there was bite rails and swings shovels and pics yeah and the anger you know because it's all piece work you got paid for the tons of coal that you loaded and if it wasn't coming easy and you had too much rock and that sort of thing it's a frustrating job when you have a family to support it's very tough yeah my lungs are probably black brown green everything you know five five and a half no I had a long before long before I don't know you just do you know you have to do something you do it it's that kind of thing you're standing I've been in gold mines visiting just visiting and looking you know you wouldn't get me back in a mine ever not anymore yes I have some live back there they don't work in a coal mine anymore but most of my family is scattered all over the world that's what I am it's the Mongolian blood you know the Indians and the Mongols are supposed to be related they did come over to America from um land that connected Siberia with Alaska bearing strait yeah my daughter has a Mongolian mark on her backside there was some yeah there were some paediatricians they kept seeing this appear it's a blue birthmark and they couldn't figure out why you know some babies had it and some babies didn't and they traced it to Genghis Khan a Mongolian spot they call it yeah this is what he says I don’t know whether they'll take all of you up oh yeah we were shooting in the Bronx and i'd have knocks on the dressing room door the guy would come stick his head in and he would say hey you know I knew Cargo Joe Cargo I said who Joe Cargo then I remember he used to be called Cargo they call him Cargo and um I'd say yeah well uh come on in invite him in he'd talk a little while but you find out he doesn't know anything anyhow only what he read he really knew him but not well and i was trying to seek information because he had plenty of information about Winston Churchill you know  but Valachi there wasn't that much except that that you found in the Valanchi papers in the book well when you consider Joe Valachi being raised in the Bronx during the depression days even before that but he was a young man during the depression he had two brothers that were in a mental institution he loved his sister and she died at a very young age and he made a coffin for out of orange crates I mean this is the kind of poverty he lived in you see and buried her himself he grew up this way and he made a choice he chose a profession he knew that he had to accept you know then the penalties that profession paid to him he was being a soldier at that time he wasn't fighting society as such he was fighting other gangs and it was like a war this is all he was he was a soldier and in this picture this is how I play him he was a follower and not a leader no he died about 1969 66 you getting frightened talking talking about joe Vallanchi thinking he was alive no his wife was is alive and his son his wife is still alive and so he's a son no they're very unhappy we've had it changed yes we've had to change names even some places the names of some places because there have been threats there have been threats of lawsuit as well you know from the innocent who had been involved and uh Dino de Laurentiis he produced the picture told me it received a letter from you know a high mafia leader in this city to watch it also Dino de Laurentiis got permission from a high mafia leader in this city to work in this city on the Valachi pavements that's interesting is that how you get permission to work here when you do anything about the mafia you got to have permission you got to have permission up to a point not really permission but it's safer to have one
