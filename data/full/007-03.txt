no no that’s right I I I I did I done did it one of those televisions with Chris Moyes you know just because he's a laugh and a giggle you see but no I was waiting for the right thing to come along because Peggy she's a she's a hard actor follower and EastEnders and uh and I was so lucky with that and this came along little crackers and I'd seen it like last year on Sky and it and it got nominated for BAFTAs I think that was uh uh there was Stephen Fry and uh Catherine Fey yeah yeah and I saw it and there were only ten minutes so even if you start to look at the evening yes last year it was about Christmas this year is my first so when they asked me to do my first of course the ego went ah yes the first time I saw the show the thing you know it was a bit like that it was all about showbiz and now I can board what all that you know but they said no no we wanted uh something when you were younger you see well we I looked at a time in my life which which had a we had show business in but also my first bra my first browser it was I know it sounds dark and you see those you think how could she be worried about that but I was I was four foot ten and a half size two shoes and I had these knockers you know and I hated it I hated it but at the same time I was playing I was I got a job in fin in uh Love From Judy and it was a big West End show and it went for two and a half years and you had to be 15 because they didn't want to play for chaperones but you had to look 10 see I played it at law firm with the plaits like that you see so I went into this show and there was other eight eight other orphans and they all grew up that way and they got the sack but I stayed I stayed you see and suddenly you had terrible wardrobe mistresses and those it's not like it is now you see and they used to scream and shout and look it's have you got that on have you got a don't sit in your costume up and all that used to going it used to be awful got the same eye makeup on yeah yeah yeah always it was so strict so they did like this oh my god it was it was awful and Leslie Joseph I said there's only one person can play that wardrobe mistress it's Leslie Jones because she don't care and she did exactly what I asked her to yeah the in the mouth you know oy all right oy Barbara Deeks which is my real name wait come here and she looks at me and she says those two things you're meant to be playing a ten-year-old not at the Moulane Rouge so she that's me all that and that's exactly what happened to me so for eight I was fif- I was just getting on for 16 because the show went for two and a half years you see so I and I I was I was uh very you know conscious about it yeah yeah so I and and for the 18 months I had this great lump of elastic around me you see and then when I came out the show my mother it was this this cockney snob I've told you about before she said now Babs we're going to have the best bra for you the best brazier so it's a whole thing to get a brazier at the young girl's first prize it isn't like that now they're wearing them at 10 aren't they you know so we went to Barnes and Hollingsworth because that had to be Borns and Hollingsworth and of course I I went in to get this bra but it had to be a burley because they're the best perhaps they're the best of the best and that was it and but I and then when I put them on and I my first experience in the street walking down the street the first thing I ever heard was ah darling you see your feet lately I wouldn't like them on me face real wall all the things like that and I hated it and I got my life which makes me laugh you know it was a hassle to to carry on yes I might yes I know it’s strange yes there are there's me there's Johnny Vegas there's Jane Horrocks and they're they’re wonderful they're just as I say 10 minutes and uh and I I'm very very thrilled to meet my I I I feel mine I I I saw it last week and it's very real yeah and I've shared a few tips oh my god Sally Hawkins award winner you know I mean yeah and lovely Neil Jackson from upstairs downstairs when I first saw him when he opened his mouth and said hello Babs who’re you today Veronica Lake or Betty Gravel because I used to want to be one of the other I I just cried that's when I sat and watched them yeah and she playing my mother she's got a right to the t that snobbishness yes I know well I didn't want to do that but they want you to do it don't they I just wanted to narrate it and executive produce and cast it and things like that I didn't want to you know but I’m glad I did that that was well I was there wasn't I you know I mean that lovely Sa- Sam she had a little Samantha right she didn't have any experience the girls I auditioned well they had this preconceived idea about me obviously you know it was too much too much and I'm not actually when I well at work I am but in real life I'm I’m not so much and um she got it just right and she got very emotional when she played it as well she was a bit too tall but that didn't matter it was very difficult to get a four foot ten and a half blonde you know with the knockers of of that size too they they don't come they’re not ready made and and so and she got me and and and I was no the whole thing is absolutely too long they are lovely oh I can't bear it Pam and she will be sorely missed more than I was missed in the show because she could go to anybody it you know any family she could go to exactly and I am devastated  yes we are and and uh we can go to dinner and go to the theatre when we’re together no well she she would just she wanted to leave but I don't know if she wanted to be killed off see that's that that's the chance you have to take I was positive I was going to go up in a load of flames with the Vic I mean you're going ah my great Vic ah I thought that was gonna happen of course it didn't but Pam I was very very surprised because she could always always come back that’s so you know but she's accepted it now and she’ll have a new life I I I don't think so I I I don't think so no you can't say that well you you mustn't say no I love the show very very much and I was 16 years was the best thing ever I loved it and I thanked them from the bottom of my heart but I I don't know I don't know I don't think I could work that pub yeah no no there are things that hush my mouth she mustn't say
