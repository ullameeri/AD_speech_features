the uh the opportunity came about in uh 54 and they made it known to anybody interested that this was going to be the first adult western which meant that the stories were going to be about people that actually lived and the wardrobe would be authentic and I was one of um about 20 people I guess it was up for the role the gentleman that was the uh historian that had written a book about Wyatt Erp Stuart Like he's the only person the Wyatt Earp ever uh authorized to really do a story about him and Wyatt Earp himself uh lived here in Los Angeles at the end of his life and uh died on 13 street in 1929 uh anyway uh I think that that uh that Stuart kind of favoured me for a couple of different reasons um he I think felt that there was a certain uh physical uh likeness in structure and height and gauntlets or whatever you want to call it at that time uh but I think also the fact that he was a marine and I was a marine had something to do with it and uh because I he we later talked about he said you know there was a lot of uh uh marine corps in Wyatt Earp the actual guy who I he did things in thought and the way that he uh worked as a team with people and uh one way or the other uh there were there were quite a few very big names that were offered the role and uh I finally was the one that was chosen the weather also from my point of view there were I was up for four other series at the time and one of them was going to be done in Africa and it was wow that would be you know till you go to Africa and have a great you know couple years I didn't think it would uh last too long and I was right it only lasted about eight or ten shows or whatever another one uh well the bottom line is that I kind of focused on wanting to do Wyatt Earp again I had an argument with the agency who felt that I should take the other show because it paid twice as much and they would get there for twice the commission I said uh that may be true in the beginning but I Wyatt Earp actually lived there's a tremendous story about that man and the people that he knew and the development of the west and the whole economics of the west and the western part of the United States and uh I think it's going to have legs and I was right and therefore in the beginning I get paid last short then if I'd had done the other show but the other show only last two years or lasted down six and it also led to so many other things so it was a wise choice but I damn near lost it also whether uh they sent me to Western costume to you know take a look at the you know with wardrobe and uh some of what the pic top was okay but a lot of it wasn't uh this is a a true life uh picture of what the west was like and therefore uh if anybody should be wearing authentic clothes it should be Wyatt and back in those days there weren't any uniforms for peace officers the city cop or the the this case the marshal uh they wore what the guy that owned the hardware store or the mayor uh so I chose the black frock-coat and the best um the biggest problem was the hat they wanted me to wear this beige coloured hat and I said uh first of all the real guys in the Old West didn't wear light-coloured hats because they get dirty too damn soon and also the uh the reason your wore a hat was to protect you from the the sun I mean I was the reason why uh they had the broad bri- uh brims and I had selected this black hat which was the berries from the Spanish and Mexican flatbread they said um you know I said  that's what I want to wear I think it will be distinctive and uh they finally let me do it and of course it became very much of a trademark and then in the field when he went out on horseback he wore uh you know the work shirt and uh the equivalent of what were Levi's in those days and what other people the one on the trail what they wore it wasn't fancy shirts and uh you know with the polka dots and all that kind of stuff but the uh the dialog also uh they let me almost from the very beginning work on the script and and if there was something that didn't sound quite right they would let me change it to what would be a actual conversation or the kind of thing that uh it would had more reality to it but I in doing interviews right away and and everything on the show because it was an instant hit uh they would always ask me youand what's this about an adult western movie and what and I would explain you know that the stories were about people that actually lived these are incidents that actually happened the wardrobe and all but I also just to cut through it came up with a very short definition of an adult western which is uh in an adult western the cowboy he still kisses a horse but he worries about it uh the other part of the uh the character that became very important was the ability to uh do the quick draw and I I didn't want to uh force him into having to cut away whenever that happened I wanted it to be realistic so similar to the wheelchair learning that I uh asked them if I uh this man or Werlow Jala who was well known and making holsters and he had offered me this uh double uh holster uh and for a very reasonable price 75 bucks which I didn't have and I took it to to the agent and I an I said to the agent you know please see uh if Philip buy this for me or whatever so that because I'd want to on my own time practice the quick-draw or Billy learn how to do it so he came back a few days later he said now that's your problem that they don't care about that you want to learn how to do the quick-draw that's up to you ok so I learned how to do the quick draw a couple thousand hours whatever it was and became the fastest on the quick-draw so that you could actually on film actually see this guy it was less than uh draw cock and fire uh in less than a second would be back side maybe second and a half which became a very big promotional tool and publicity and everybody talked about the quick-draw uh about five or six or eight weeks into the show we were now doing tremendous uh and I again had the agent talk to them but they now consider giving me the $75 for the holster I’m using uh and the word came back no you bought it it's up to you if you don't want to use that holster we have holsters you can use I thought about that another thing my dad taught me in that I learned from my dad is that never ever make a snap decision something if it's important sleep on it give yourself time to really think it through so I went home and I slept of it next day I went into the set and I went to our prop master and uh how much stuff do we rent here I mean it's it all rented he said yeah all the firearms of saddles saddlebags the canteens the rifles I said what is it uh what is it run we can he said it's about a little over a thousand dollars or 1200 sometimes it's 1500 so how would you like to make 10% of that every week how I said well there's a new company called national gun registered gun rental uh and if you run from them you get you'll get ten percent said I never heard of them I said no I just started it today and I took the first money I turned from Wyatt Earp and I went out and with the prop master and a few other people bought all the guns in the saddles and the holsters and that holster rented for about uh ten bucks a week so that holster eventually brought me a little most $2,000 the length of the show plus I rented all the other equipment so if you can't beat them join them or do something okay but if you think it out there's a way to overcome almost anything but that that's kind of a marine attitude  hmm I think you can tell I have a hearing problem from all those damn guns I shot out by the way let me just say this that in terms of the guns themselves when you do a film or you do a television show or whatever and you have explosions you know guns that go off they use quarter loads that means a quarter of what the real sound is uh it's like a pop but I wanted the authenticity of the guy really hearing the explosion so insisted on using full loads so the guy that was standing opposite me uh when that full explosion of a 45 went on he he didn't have to act he did react okay um so that became another kind of uh a token of you know what the program and and now I'm paying for because they do have a a hearing loss so I wouldn't advise anybody to surround themselves uh with loud noises that's why so many of our band people and uh rock and roll and so forth and have hearing problems ask me again what you wanted well first of all he was born in Illinois he was born in La Mant Illinois and then uh his parents moved to Iowa and uh I'm sure you know something about wagon trains you know uh but I don't know if you know this part that what they would do yes you had to have the trail boss he was the Scout he knew the territory had been there before he know how to handle the the Indians he knew how to deal with the with nature but the people who were in the wagon trains they they were farmers they were businessmen uh in this case with uh with Wyatt Earp's father uh each wagon train had what was called a wagon master or a person that was uh the manager so to speak of the of the group five families ten families 12 15 families in the wagon train all of who paid for to be part of this wagon train uh and it was like a miniature greyhound or a train company except that they were wagons and they gave because of his management background they gave Wyatt Earp's father the trail boss he was the manager and uh he they gave him free passage and he just took care of all the problems with the families and anything that uh came up or somebody disagree with how much water we got today are much food or whatever it was he would manage that he so they came out and they settled in uh Colton just right next door to uh uh San Bernardino and uh about four or five weeks uh Wyatt was about 15 at the time and he forgot his toothbrush or something and they decided to go back and uh pick up something or do something that he had to do I never did quite figure that one out but he he decided he wanted to work his way back so he went to San Pedro down at the Harbor and got a job hauling a six up um that's a wagon pulled by six horses uh four uppers and wagon hold my forwards and his first load uh uh was to Phoenix Arizona it was the first printing press that went into Phoenix Arizona uh then he went on uh continued East and uh stopped to see an old front of the family and Ellsworth Kansas and that's where the first uh situation uh uh happened he was up against some bad guys and it was it's a true story he had this fun there was a cherub use quite old and the Thompson brothers uh had a too much drink of whatever they would say they treat the town in other words he just shot off the guns and everybody ran off the streets and everything and uh sheriff was afraid to come out and so Wyatt borrowed he’s gun and strapped it on went out to these there were three of them plus the 10 or 15 in the group and he walked right up to Ben Thompson and right in front of his house and he said you got to get out of town and the guy looks at this kid is now about 16 and said uh what makes you think that we're going to leave town because you say so he said if you don't I'm going to take you to jail oh really really how are you going to do that with all of these runners well it's very simple uh you can shoot me and there's no question you guys are more than I am but I guarantee I'm going to shoot you and what goods can be if you don't have a life anymore and Ben looked at me and said you know the kid I believe this kid and he said let's go on we're going to jail they went into jail and they paid each one a three dollar fine whatever it was but that was the first that was the first uh incident and basically what it was oh yeah okay I'm gonna go and you'll win except you the other guys will live but you can lose your life in the process so he if it's those kind of that kind of thinking of whatever that people believed him and that it's no screwing around with Wyatt Earp and that that's kind of the history of his life of the you know uh went through the various stages uh one of the interesting things about the character was his marriage to Josie do you know anything about that Josie uh graduated from uh Stephen's College in Missouri and her roommate as a as the story goes uh lived in Arizona uh near Tucson and they went out west on her way home which was up and open her father owned a chain of grocery stores Jewish family and uh she uh and her girlfriend went by tombstone and she met sheriff Peon and I guess they kind of fell in love for a bit and then she met Wyatt Earp and Wyatt Earp and sheriff Peon had a little discussion and Wyatt married Josie and the father in Oakland it was absolutely furious because his little Jewish princess never got back for the big you know graduation from school type of party that there was put up and they never did speak after that and uh when she was after the ok corral after a short time and he had a good friend by the name of Jack London up in uh uh Alaska and come on up here was a lot of money up here silver all that he has and he went up there aren't opened the saloon it's still there and then when he came back he uh did a few things in different parts of the state and then he phoned up here on 13 street and what he died uh Josie called her dad and said well dad you got you wish Wyatt’s dead what'll I do with him he said cremate the son of a bitch and bring him up here we'll bury him so she did and she took him up by train the ashes and he's buried in a Jewish cemetery in Burlingame California just below San Francisco and uh to put it mildly at a very very interesting life by the way the book that she wrote it's called Josie it's a it's a great book for anyone to read there was another tremendous character that came on the set uh same as L Jennings he was known as the great train robber and uh he was 81 or 82 and they let him out of 11 worth be- because of age been in prison with some 30 40 years Wyatt had put him there and uh so he went out west to see his over and Wyatt Earp and they we had a lot of people that would come on the set that actually knew Wyatt uh so he came on the set and he actually was kind of like he really did believe I was you know the real Wyatt Earp and he's quite old now and uh I guess about the third fourth day Jamie said that I'm getting the hell out of here uh this is such bullshit and I said well oh really he said  well yeah you guys have gun fights every day and you know that fights you know and one of the shows he said you know we were lucky if we did one of those a week much less but anyway he said he was leaving I said well where are you heading said well I don't have any friends they're all dead all my friends and my family are all dead now I'm going to go back the only friends I’ve got are living with so I go back to live with so I said how he leaves how are you gonna get there so you must think I'm stupid and he calls out this Greyhound bus ticket he said I bought a round-trip ticket at the Grayhound so he took off and I gave him a hundred bucks and you don't want to take it I said here buy a couple steaks on the way back to Kansas and uh next day I'd think about it can you see this old man gonna go up knock nut on the gate that man and uh so I I called the the warden and after about two or three different people they finally put me uh through the warden and Wyatt Earp what the hell does Wyatt Earp want with me and then uh so you got a visitor and it's gonna show up in the next couple of days he's a long time tenants name is Allan James he said Jesus is that the best news I've had this year Al was one of the best bakers we've ever had I'm going to put him in charge of our damn bakery so he showed up uh the warden had him move into the house when he and his family and every night they would take him by car inside 11 worth uh you know bakeries go to work at about one or two in the morning and he was in charge of the bakery for the 11 worth crescent until he died I think he was about 93 so he lived another good 10 years but wonderful funded stories like that these people that actually lived well of course you have to you have to have a beginning uh a middle and the end of a story and you try to do that in 30 minutes uh there were some things that were imagined or a little bit fictitious but when whenever we could we stayed to the truth uh of the people that uh remble uh many of the people uh like Ned Buntline the Buntline special uh actually lived and his story is true he wrote what they called in those days penny dreadfuls and they sold for a nickel or dime and he decided you want to go out there and do some uh some real stories about the guys who were actually out there so he got Colt uh firearms company make up he's 60-inch barrel pistols and he took about five or six of them out west with him and he he gave one to sheriff bn12 Tillman and gave one to Wyatt Earp Wyatt Earp kept his and ran it out of town but not before in the show we do uh quite a few uh episodes with Ned Buntline that were uh relatively true to what could have happened you know some of it of course was fictitious we had it but the basics were Ned Buntline in the Buntline  special now that developed there were only six of them as I understood today there must be two or three hundred around the world that say they have one of the original six Buntlines I have one but those others are obviously the real thing uh that’s another thing that I insisted on doing I wanted to do uh as much as they would let me do uh they frowned on my jumping out of a second-story window and things like that because they wanted me to come to work the next day and we did have uh some very very wonderful stuntman Lauren James and oh Archie Butler and uh guys like that but uh but most of the time uh I did as much of my own stunts as I felt was wise to do and also as much as they would let me to do something they just didn't want me to even think about because if I busted a like them what the hell do I really covered and what we would do is uh in a fight or whatever uh we'd have a a stuntman uh help me by doing you know working out the routine and stuff and then I if I thought that I could handle it I would step in and do it but the important thing is that the stuntman got paid for doing the groundwork on it so I always saw that no matter what I did and in the other shows that I did that uh the stunt the stuntman would always have his chance to do a run through with it and that they had they had to pay it not just the salary for the day but whatever the going rate was the toughest well there were two tough ones uh roping a rhinoceros that's probably the most difficult stunt that I ever was involved in and uh nobody had ever done it before nobody's ever going to do it again and the other was the harpy eagle uh with the rhinoceros in Africa Texas style they also called a cowboy in Africa uh at the end of the show the hero the character I plays gets knocked off his horse and all he has got the horse takes off all he's got is a Larry up his rope and he's trying to get back to home base and here's this rhino and on the script it's about uh just about an inch in description about the character roping the rhinoceros to a tree why the hell do you do that and uh give us Mickey Gilbert was uh a stunt man on the show and nobody had ever done this before so the first thing we do we’d see uh just like you would with a bull you you test it to see which way it's going to hook as it comes to you it's going to hook it either hooks left or right and you whatever way that is you go to the opposite you wait until the last moment who's this you know for ton train coming at you and you wait until it's just about far as me to you and you just step step aside throw the the rope over his neck and one way or the other uh the rhino uh dragged me uh first Mickey and then me they dragged us about 1,500 feet and when we got up and ran to the tree it wasn't where we were supposed to be and the tree was only about this you know this uh big in terms of uh circumference and pushes my god is this going to hold that rhino and what happens the the crew picked up where they work you ran over and started filming and and uh what simply uh kept going around the tree and the rhino following me and as a result tied himself to the tree and there's this picture here at some place I'm standing here tree in the middle the Rhino like only four feet between us and I tied to a tree but that I don't want to do don't want ever do that one again
