hmm Jackson uh Gordon uh that character commanders in chief count I’ve played three presidents like the guy i played in Will Penny you'd uh you'd have to call kind of a sloppy guy he was illiterate you know well that's one of the things that appealed to me about uh Will Penny which I I liked enormously it was uh went uh generally unrecognized as a film but uh you know I liked it oh boy lots and lots of people every part you lose is a heartbreaker uh the uh well I remember very early in my career and obviously long before they adjusted the aim of the film in the direction it should have gone I uh Stanley Kramer offered me High Noon when they had it and before somebody pointed out it should be an older guy and should should obviously be Gary Cooper and uh which is one of the reasons it became a great film but I must say that's one of the castings I agree with though absolutely yeah oh sure you mean uh there's a lot of times you disagree uh with the concept of a scene the writing the directing uh I uh my rule of thumb on it is the director is supposed to be the captain and I always say at the beginning I have a loud voice and argue a lot but if you ever get tired of arguing why just say look do it this way because I want you to do it this way and I think the actor is supposed to do it then there are you know Dennis Hopper and a couple of guys would disagree with me but I think that's the way you're supposed to play it sure I think you have to of course uh film is the director's medium uh on the stage finally the curtain goes up and the director goes across the street to sardines and gets smashed and it belongs to the actor it's actor’s country but film which is something writers often don't understand either film is not an actor's medium it's not a writer's medium it is a director's medium the film only exists in the director's mind really even when you've shot it well you can finish the whole picture people say well how did it turn out you say I have no idea you know I half the time I'm involved in the pictures I make from the very beginning perhaps the first person involved and I've seen the various versions of the script and involved in the casting and you know the design and all that stuff and even so I see the dailies and the rough cuts of the scene but the director and the editor and the producer are mainly the director in the editor are putting the picture together and until that happens the picture doesn't exist what you shot has only the most remote relationship to to the finished film you see a rough cut of a scene and you say yeah that's uh that's what we did it looks like it's in there you you this is something you come to realize uh painfully over the years I think that uh your performance all all you can be sure of the the notes you make for yourself after a scene after looking at it the next day the best you can ever say is it looks like it's in there now whether it will cut together into the director's concept and whether the the director's concept is going to work is something you can't tell but you certainly can't second guess him on the set oh often very much yeah shoot I should have remembered what I said  actually I have no desire to direct because it's uh that's a whole it is well people automatically imagine that uh that actors want to direct I don't think so I've directed on the stage it's a a big nothing for me but the closest you know the the things that interest me in film other than acting are things that i can have some hand in anyway as it happens casting the shape of a script things like that and the only other part of it that would attract me at all is the editing I made a a picture with Orson Welles once and I spent a picture called A Touch Of Evil and Wells is probably the most talented single guy I've ever worked for in terms of just that single element of talent there that's not the only thing it's you know like like saying a a pitcher has great control but that may not be all you know it's he still may not be a great pitcher um but that one thing Wells had so much he's and I remember sitting I spent a couple of weeks after the picture was finished sitting in the cutting room watching him and it you know it's like a guy putting a watch together and he'd sit there with these big cigars dropping ashes all over the film and taking sometimes the moving of three frames of film from here to there can I promise you make more of a contribution to the scene than what the actor did uh with the whole scene film is that kind of a medium it’s fascinating sure exactly it’s that kind of a medium exactly it’s more like chess than anything else Jennifer Jones yeah that's true well it was on the scene you know she uh just is a very strong girl she hit me as hard as I've ever been hit I think practically  I don't know how hard Bowie Goodman can hit her no no I backed up I figured she might swing with the other hand but if actually the film shows quite frequently on the late late show uh these days it's a picture called Ruby Gentry and through about uh four-fifths of the movie you'll notice she suddenly starts wearing a lot of silver Mexican bracelets and that was to conceal a very adroitly designed fine steel brace that went from about their upper wrist and she has her whole oh about two and a half pounds I'm glad she wasn't wearing those when she slapped me or she would have killed me  that's the one that did the damage yeah that was no acting at all that was pure terror the the nose was broken before she hit me but uh yeah that's a a relic of my spectacularly unsuccessful career as a football player in high school I uh went to high school and like most American kids I was or I had done team sports and I was about as tall as I am now in high school but I think I only weighed about 165 pounds and that's really not not the ideal build for even high school football nose was the first to go I broke my finger then I tried out for freshman ball at Northwestern and they had a good team and that was when Pappy Waldorf was coaching and Otto Graham was a senior the year I was a freshman and I very quickly realized that this was a terrible idea so that was the end of my football career until a couple of years ago I played a a pro quarterback uh in a picture about the New Orleans Saints called Number One that it's much easier if you know how the game's but I've cracked a rib in that but a couple of notices sometimes have uh smarted a bet just the last 50 yards well I asked mr Demille not to add any sharp rocks but uh I think he had an arrangement with uh somebody up there and it worked out okay uh that was uh I suppose it's a long past the event now but this was uh supposed to be a deep dark secret at the time but uh for the dialogue between Moses and the burning bush which is presumed to be the voice of god after going through any number of trial voices on it uh why I did the voice of god which is reasonable because I suppose where do you hear the voice of god but inside yourself so uh my voice would do as well as anyone's oh no he did it marvellously now you're thinking uh in his own film The Bible in which I think the best sequence was his sequence says Noah and he did his own again when he was conversing with god why uh he was god too Bill Cosby does a pretty good dialogue with uh between Noah and god too no it's all right it's alright if I had known we were going to be concentrating on it so much I'd have had him put some makeup on it  no that’s that's this little nervous habit I have no this was for the agony and the ecstasy and Michelangelo's nose if you can believe it was even more broken than mine is and so in an attempt to distort it more to the side they just put a a plastic you could call it a noodle I guess up then it pulled it out to one side the hole in it obviously was to breathe through you're giving them all these little things to watch for in my old movies keep their mind on it all of them
