and I’d just like to say thanks for getting that video on a DVD and I hope it’s it’s shit hot the last two decades just keep following us around they got brain kids down they still following us around so Angus worries a lot if the gig is right for the night you know and em that’s his pre-show nerves but I watch him you know a couple minutes before he goes on he’s ready you know it’s right you know and all the lads are not lazy everyone once and again will get together we can check it all it’s our home on that stage it’s the only two hours of a day that we get praised I’m just one of those I don’t even know where I am most of the time so if it’s fire enough the band’s really cooking that’s the highlights of the tour you know those moments you know the the those just share pleasure it’s just one of those things yeah if it if it never comes to the day where we thought we weren’t cutting the mustard that’ll be it we don’t wanna stop coz is is like you say we go for the pleasure you know we’ve been doing it a long time the money is all there we’ve all done pretty well on that but so the thing to shoot for is your craft you know to be the best at it you know and that’s all we try there was a new band the other day that was older than us what do you think of that
