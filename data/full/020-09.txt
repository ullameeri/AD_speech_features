my favorite Club is always the home team I'm for the Mets and for the Yankees both but I have a soft spot in my heart also for the Angels because I uh was out there and I want to see Gene Autry win one he's not going to do it this year looks like the twins and the Western Division I think well the Mets uh after tonight are one and a half back and certainly they've got a very good shot but you know we've all been watching the Cardinals you got to watch Montreal because they're coming right along it's gonna be a great finish well I've got to give a little credit first to uh the captain Keith Hernandez you know got the second hit the first hit of the inning and then the Darryl Strawberry's tied the score another thing I want to say let's give a little credit to Barry uh Gary Carter you know I thought it was really bad when the fans booed him because this guy's playing hurt you as a catcher know it's a toughest position to play and I was so glad to see him come through three hits drove in around and so forth because he's a fine catcher handles those pitchers so here's one for Carter too it's the most exciting thing to watch him uh he gets up there uh they used to say that was exciting when Babe Ruth struck out uh it was exciting when Reggie Jackson struck out it isn't quite that way yet with Darryl but believe me when he hits one uh I noticed that when you announce the games you say it's gone the minute he hits the ball but others you wait like Mookie tonight you wait a little while before you thought it was out but Darryl there was no question except the second one I think was a little closer but the first one was such a towering beautiful shot well baseball in baseball season I like football too but I would say year in and year out baseball because you can see it and hear it every day and on top of it and you can get it every day here in New York did you have one favorite baseball player hard to say anybody that was a favorite uh looking back over the years I remember particularly of course the great New York teams uh I remember too the the great teams in Philadelphia that Connie Mack had uh it's hard to pick out one I think I think of the exciting players I'd have to say Reggie uh of our time Reggie Jackson I mean when he got up there I mean it was either a home run a strikeout but whatever he did it was sent the fans really into ecstasy the best player I've ever seen uh well let me say at the present time looking at the mess I would pick Hernandez Hernandez he hits well he doesn't hit that many home runs but he gets four averages as we know but we got to remember that fielding is defence just like in football defence is just as important his offence and Hernandez saved so many runs uh you if it's anywhere in the neighborhood Hernandez gets it I would say overall I would pick him as the best player in the Mets team you're never wrong well as a matter of fract fact fact after I was defeated for president the first time in 1960 uh I was approached by some of the Yankee people as to the possibility of my being considered for uh commissioner baseball let me tell you was very tempting at that time after it was it was time to change career but uh but I would say that the next best job I would like though would be yours I want to be writer I mean to travel with the teams to be able to talk about the game to uh follow it to get to know the players I think that's got to be the greatest job in the world depends on how much you're paid oh yes but I just didn't go to throw out the first ball you know when I was vice president mrs. Nixon likes the game too and our daughters did and many times we went to Griffith Stadium and believe me you gotta be a baseball fan if you were from Washington and uh we used to go there all that time throw off the ball uh Eisenhower went on occasion but not always uh and I I thought it was a great privilege to throw it out but what I prefer to do is to go not there's a celebrity to throw out the ball and get the cheers or the booze or whatever the politician gets but I like to be in the stands to be there with the people like for example here in New York Mets I got a friend Bob Atmom's got a marvelous box and I'm always invited stated but I prefer to sit right out there the stands where you get the feel of the game you do not really appreciate a baseball game sitting in a box you got to sit in there with the fans I was there you know let me say I had a hole-in-one in golf once and I was played with some people who had played all their lives they said they not only had never had one they had never been with somebody when they had it and to be there for a no-hitter it was an exciting event oh absolutely I've never done I've never seen one even on television but it was a great uh experience and I was really surprised when George Steinbrenner made him a reliever he was too and uh we'll have to see what the Yankees do next year to play first base as a matter of fact one who was a very been baseball's Ranger dampens Woodrow Wilson we always think of Wilson you know it being the great intellectual uh as he was you know President of Princeton the rest uh but he knew the game another very good athlete was right Eisenhower uh Eisenhower could have play second base but I think he would be better as an outfield oh I don't think well you have to go back earlier may- maybe Madison he was very short yes Lincoln I imagine would not have been a particularly good athlete he was very strong you know we remember his being of course the woodchopper and all the rest uh but he would obviously be an outfielder maybe he's a designated hitter in in American League oh let's see it would be the best picture maybe Theodore Roosevelt you know he's he's a leader type he would get up there and he'd stomp around the mound and uh particularly I think he would be the best picture as a reliever he would frighten them to death well you know they they claim to have invented a lot of things uh and as far as baseball is concerned however I would like to see them take it up seriously because as we know from the Olympics uh living out what their political philosophy is uh the Russians are great people and they are great athletes and I would like to see the time come when underneath the Russians have baseball the Chinese have baseball the Japanese at baseball we have an SST supersonic plane supplies it we have really a world series in which the whole world plays well it's a pleasure to be with you and I wish I had your job
