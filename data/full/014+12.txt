well if he doesn’t I think we’re all in a sad state no uh seriously I think to to sort of um put it all in a little nutshell um to me he asked us to in the most beautiful exquisite charming charitable language to please please get our act together and I don’t think there was anyone in that gathering that didn’t agree with him really down deep in their hearts I know I do thoroughly I find um to me anyway he is probably the most important man in this world today and it is because he has wisdom he has courage he has suffered a great deal he also is dedicated to the truth as he sees it and I don’t think that any human being can ask any more of a man of his statue after all he is not just a holy father to Rome catholics as he says he is I think the citizen of the world I love him no I didn’t I was two people away from him but I got a lovely look at him and really the graces that emanate from him are almost enough to sustain you well we can certainly hope that was his whole message wasn’t it uh Frank Capra one time I think I was 18 or 19 at the time and I did a Picture with him called the Platnum Blonde and um he said to me well now Loretta what do you think about this scene and I said well um um it’s alright Mr Capra you just tell me what you want and I’ll try to do what you what pleases you oh he said Loretta uh acting is only thinking it’s very important what you think and I said oh and this whole world opened up and then from then on God help any poor director who said to me yeah what do you think I said well I don’t think so I don’t think I wanna do that
