this is a pretty good closure I mean not my old buddy here and and Charles Sappnafell some years ago at an ACSA meeting um said we you ought to come to Ball State one of these times so finally Charles Here I am finally it's been a been a while it's an honor to be here I've been using those those jars all my life you know and and uh it's I guess I start ok turn them down and um are they on I got to turn them on technology pause here now they should go I push both on/off beats PowerPoint anyway right thank you thank you I owe you that that pen and they need to go back to zero thank you well I can I'm good at ad libbing because this is I remember one time it may might have been that a CSA meeting where um they dropped my slides on the floor in San Francisco remember that one and uh that was the ultimate travesty and I've learned to cope since then so no problem to talk about architecture for me means talking about um a special realm that I've kind of grown up in like I might practice and it's a realm that that travels through time unbelievably the sky is transformed now and the sky has a signature and it's a cultural artifact look this is looking at my balcony toward the Rio Grande and the mountains beyond and the contrails in the sky describe trajectories of motion and they're like the Santa Fe Trail ruts in some ways but they're there ephemera rather than them in a permanent kind of trace and compared to the trace you see on the right which is a inscription Rock El Morro near Grant's New Mexico this is really a conquistador graffiti you know somebody passed by named what’s his name  Ramon Garza or La Russa passed by in 1709 that written scription inscription is just as fresh as it is if it were done yesterday so there's a timeless quality about the land there and uh the land- landscape apparitions that the luxury refers to talk refers to has has to do with land form becoming architecture maybe where you kind of blur your eyes and uh it's either landscape or it's uh uh an architectural piece and in silhouette in New Mexico there's this mythic time is marked by solstice events in Chaco Canyon in particular on the right that's a Sun Dagger atop Fajada Butte were and solstice is that moment of sunrise in the winter it strikes a mark on the rock through a through a crevasse and an artist named um Steve Fitch really Minh aided the petroglyphs of the the Southwest and showed them in ways that they were originally seen with fire eliminating them rather than and just they like in this journey through the landscape through these landscapes of uh of power and beauty it's important for me it has been for to to always refer to the timeless possibility in Rome the Pantheon for me is an icon that watch you can go they're really cheap they're only a hundred bucks I want you to go out and buy one at the your nearest nearest museums museum shop but the Pantheon one thing that's really messing me up is I've got the trays reversed so could you reverse the trays otherwise you would never know but it's driving me crazy you know that feeling of you know like it's looking at something backwards so just switch him flip him over if you would please anyway the the Pantheon an icon of timelessness it began as a pagan temple it metamorphosed into a consecrated church now it's a consecrated tourist stop or whatever you call it and it through all those those uh metamorphoses yet its power persisted as an authentic place of of of original place of beauty and irrespective of its of its program it just had that that quality that arkad great architecture has that transcends programm where the programs kind of like um a layer of clothing um that you that architecture wears and the the architecture below the naked architecture is the architecture of of a timeless possibility um I was looking at watching the Danny DeVito movie the Renaissance man the other night and he was talking about uh Albertie Leon Battista Alberti Batti- Battista Alberti the great Renaissance man who was a poet philosopher architect painter and Danny DeVito's coaching these if you saw the movie coaching these army recruits and teaching them Shakespeare and he said remember um it's okay to be an athlete Alberti could stand in front of um someone and in one jump jump over them and land on the other side at the same time you know be a poet and philosopher so the body and architecture has always been an important to me that to to to work your body to for me running marathons skiing etc and to prove it there I am skiing one of my buildings I'm getting air off of a clerestory of a building in Taos Ski Valley so the body in space um there's some light that's started hitting the screens we lose that light that one not that doesn't need to be here does it try to lose that one if you can whoever is the the light pro here so on to a little um and whoever is up there then I thank you for your helping could you check focus every now and then I can't tell back here this one's really in focus or not just sort of don't just sort of spot-check them please thank you thank you um anyway the um no keep going the beginning of my um not being a regionalist I decided it was no more mr. Adobe I'm you know I was out in New Mexico and I want to cut this competition on the right for the Arizona uh Science Center I mean the Arizona State University Fine Arts Center and then later the Wyoming Heritage Center it's almost like a great ancient helmet of copper or or a surrogate Mountain I was reading John McPhee McFee is so great and so inspirational for architects because he he sort of a closeted geologist and he follows geologists around and interprets culture through their eyes towards these amazing places of of myth and um and beauty in the West and he wrote a book called rising from the plane he was variants insp- inspirational for me when I was we're thinking this building Wyoming on the left slide it made me realize that um that mountains are on the move mountains are still in motion is something called the lair the Laramide orogeny near Laramie Wyoming where the mountains are actually coming up out of the ground rather than wearing down like the rest of the Rockies so this is a mountain rising from a plane on the writers at Arizona State University really a processional building a choreographic kind of building a bridge that goes nowhere but takes you anywhere on a house in near Phoenix sound on the right a house that completes the X of the Rio Arroyo Hondo or the Rio Hondo Canyon your Skotowski Valley if you get the right camera angle they Venice Beach House on the right a house that aims like an observatory toward Asia the color of the big pivot window is the color of the Japanese flag granite foreground covered with water a timeless place the place of of a the originaal LA basin rather than the the topicality of all the interventions in the LA basin a Holly- sort of the hollywood definition of l.a this is more like um an armature of bones along the sea with a granite foreground and in Dallas um a house that is grounded in the substrate of Carroll Creek with limestone ledges and a um sky ramp that zooms into the trees for my bird-watching clients check the focus please again on the left one thanks the uh mantle Weiss for Alma theater and the and the u.s. UCSD campus within enig- enigmatic wall that foregrounds the building that you pass through like like a Lewis Carroll fashion through the looking-glass we discover the realm of theater beyond a threshold between reality and dream and on the right a of Solstice wall at an elementary school in Tucson that marks time work marked celestial moments for kids they come out at night they come out at dawn on on summer or winter solstice sunrise there's even there even cultural mark Turin Cinco de Mayo for the great national national holiday of Mexico an alignment connects through one of the apertures to a a coin embedded in the sorceress Terrace which is the terrace that supports the solistice wall here's on a science center in Phoenix with the planetarium you see in them kind of the middle of the right slide focusing toward the sky almost in a James Turrell fashion of um students at Duke camp house on the building lie down on up there and look at the gaze of the sky see a bird passed by maybe a 747 37 maybe a a ray of light where the building itself becomes a kind of focal observatory much like the Venice house in Morocco in Agadir Palm Bay project gazing across the ocean uh the Atlantic shore and arcing breakwater protecting a dune line from uh from intrusion by the brackish water protecting me eucalyptus Grove beyond and seen in the stroke on the Left these are all models done in studio I think the um the thing about looking at cultures alternative cultures for inspiration this in this case the the Moorish culture of North Africa is so important to me when I was a a student I was mentioning to Joe today banister Fletcher that our history book didn't talk about the Maya didn't talk about borobudur in Java didn't talk about the great uh cultures of Asia so I tend to go fishing theoretically in the Pacific Ocean more than I do the Atlantic Ocean because it's really uh polluted with Eurocentric fish the Atlantic that is so I encourage you all to do that and to understand that the inspiration whether it's theoretical whether it's coming from say French literary criticism through people like Gary da just wonderfully inspirational needs to be balanced with Rio Angie the Great Temple of Kyoto or or with borobudur as I mentioned or with am the Maya so the Pacific Ocean laughs on the shores of uh of all these other places Africa for me has been an inspiration um at so many levels so I really tried to go to cultural roots learning some Arabic words to understand kamar the importance of the moon tower about Mecca the Mecca gateway on the complex on the right and the Scirocco how it comes off the desert blows through the building and that's really me blessing the uh model with a co2 fire extinguisher yes sir that's our technology level in our in our model shop in Las Vegas Las Vegas there's a an unbuilt project at the corner of desert sands and Las Vegas Boulevard called Atlantis and ITT Sheraton asked me uh to design a hotel for that site and when they saw it they they thought they they they made a big mi- big mistake when they saw what I done so it's uh in my spiritual savings account now so this is like a pep talk for all of you colleagues who maybe have buildings in the drawers that never got built or whatever and students who've shredded forever and haven't realized every project doesn't matter it goes into a spiritual savings account it it fills you up it comes out and lots of other guises later on so don't worry about it the uh you're seeing it the building being cruised by a stealth and if if when 117a they were Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas for a while of course you never saw them because they were stealth but they were that they were out there and I've got a kind of stealth fetish uh if you look at my website there's a stealth cookie jar you know as under the things click on things and you'll see it um anyway it's a palace of ice a palace of a crystal crystal is lucky for gamblers they were similar when you know where I'm was they gamble and and it has a sense of of a vocation of some strange tectonic aberration where maybe Atlantis crept over through tectonic plate shifts to the desert and re-erupted with fusion energy blasting out of the desert floor with a cyborg field in the foreground of the of a Casino Hotel and the uh patrons ready to roll there on the right I didn't know quite how to how uh to draw I don't draw that often I usually work in clay but I I had to figure this out and plan so I couldn't draw so I I decided to detach myself from authorship from talent from drawing and just shattered glass and see how the glass pieces turned out and uh did that and you know Polaroid photograph time scanned him in and digitized them and they they turned up in the models you see on the Left that's looking from a guest room down on the atlantean plateau to the vortex of the pool the vortex is on the left you see it in the center of the slide um I'm a I'm a Patti diver and I so I thought that people could come here with with certification and I mean equipment and dive in this 80 foot deep saltwater vortex I should find a pointer here I guess get that pointer for me figure out with a button is man will you anyway you can dive in the vortex right there thank you yeah I say you're sort of cruise out into these chambers and channels and come up to the surface look through a glass sectional floor at somebody pulling a slot handle and wave at them from below I think suri surrealism is certainly part of Vegas and part of the desert and I guess I've had my full full dose of this living there since 54 and mutating into whatever I am now in the desert the entry of the casino a great snout kind of cyborg arm the entry here two two waterfalls flanking that ITT Sheridan said pull all the stops I took him seriously so that that facet of geometry of Atlantis is played out in different ways in other projects it's sort of been a I guess a fetish of mine to the interested in in faceted geometries this is the project I'm going to show you next these are the wide-open spaces of New Mexico that's for real that's all that's there here's my clay model of the Spencer theater I call it Sierra Blanca it aims at Sierra Blanca which is a great mountain behind it aims directly at it and it's alignment is a mythic alignment connecting Sierra Blanca and in the other direction back this way to another mountain range kind of off the page of the model this is my sketch medium I I I rarely draw when I draw I make collages and I'll show a couple of them later but I draw in clay I draw a 3d and are not massing models they really are about planning section they’re they're a thoroughgoing understanding of the building and there that one's about to scale probably about I don't know three by six big field of clay and under the building and roughing out of it check the focus please thank you um you're doing an amazing job up there with baby and everything thank you Joe she she gets a raise so the Sierra Blanca the surrogaate Mountain Sierra Blanca the white limestone Sierra Blanca looking toward the actual peak and myself fetish actually is though a stealth fighter had crashed into the side of a great limestone cliff really more like a chandelier a celebration of theatre the notion that a that a chandelier can be habitable with a thousand lights on the vertices of the uh triangulated space frame of of the uh of the lobby this summer sixty eight steps coated with water coming off of a spill lip here at the theatre club uh patio to see a lobby glowing beyond in the winter white mountain the faceted geometry of the uh of of the shell of the lobby relating back to to Las Vegas perhaps and they my interest in that in that kind of crystalline form and and the um fractured glass balustrade of the the of the grand staircase up on that Minnesota I wanted to ground the project of the McNamara Alumni Alumni Center of the University of Minnesota in place uh as as deeply as I could so I made a collage piece that started with a road cut move through time including Chippewas Ojibwe learning from the Native American layer of the stratigraphy of the road cut that I imagined with each project tying it to place a landscape apparition growing out of substance of place and research to the loons to lots of snow wall I Garrison Keillor Judy Garland from Minneapolis father Hennepin always a sort of time traavel um the iconi grouping of barn silo and farmhouse that you see with the perfect render of wind row from the sky when you fly into Minnesota and maybe even see from the air here too anyway that all and Bob Dylan I want to forget him Highway 61 he was from there so this all adds up uh and by feelings to to building finally and split rock on the north shore of Lake Superior was an icon that I thought was an amazing um thing to relate to because in Minnesota there's no time you see a lot of topo from the We- West the Minnesota doesn't have much and the Mesabi Range a little bit but it's split rock you have this wonderful formation so the building began on it began to take on a character of a fractured monolith check focus over here please you can see the first the second model my first model was a clay model and then an acrylic model showing a kind of assembly the building from rays that come across flanking uh plazas later developed in this plaza scheme which is now constructed and what you won't see in the slides because it's just was just finished Plaza the four grounds the building but the monolith coming out of the earth and kind of reforming as though the earth was uh disrupted uh and then reformed to become this model with mrs. Oliver Plaza now all developed tried a shot of that so the monolith in is a Memorial Hall the blade of the building that yhat intersects the monolith is a mixed bag of University functions from from some uh  enrollment functions to the University Foundation the Alumni um offices the Regents boardroom is in the building the Great Hall the Memorial Hall becomes like a theater it brings us from uses like tailgating for ice hockey and basketball to um weddings to to uh blowouts of all sorts parties to invest investitures of a chairs and honor honorary honoring nobel fellows I received an honorary Doctorate here and was in it in my space which was the thrills of a lifetime so the monolith then leans back and it is sculpted and fractured I'm gonna show you why it leans back on this side in a second one of the interior shots there was a memorial arch it was part of a of a memorial stadium that was on the site before the project came along it was torn down in the 80s but a fragment was it was retain of this this panel of the facade and when I was engaged to do this building they the um my client said well Antoine you need to incorporate this in the facade of the building somehow and I thought you know it don't quite work that way I don't think I can pull like and pull that off but let's invite it inside the Morial hall so that that's sloping fast that I showed you it externally defines the slope of the um memorial arch it's 55 feet high give you that sense of scale weighs tons and it leans out at you like a painting it is sort of hung as an artifact symbolically on the wall and you walk through the arch into the Heritage galleries of the university so it's another kind of time travel where you move through time to engage history of the of the campus and the lining is wood polished granite coated with water um very Minnesotan in terms of materials and and a natural realm the natural realm that that that is so accessible there the uh the granite skin also can see the sort of theater of encounter where Margot Carlson the head of the Alumni Association might pop out onto her balcony and have a conversation with someone below or Jerry Jerry Fischer the uh foundation hit or the Regents can pop out above and take a look down below and and become part of a ceremony this theatrical lighting affixed to all these facets of the the copper body now the the body of the building that cuts through is the same patinaed copper and it's smooth and planar outside but when it comes inside then it becomes balcony stairs transitional levels between different programming elements of the building it's pretty noticeable on campus now now what I like about it is was that that you know Frank Gehry's Waisman museum is that the other side of campus is sort of the other gateway this is this is the North gateway so after that you know I could kind of you know relax and they understood they understand that you could get you know you didn't even relate to this cornice necessarily I respect this cornice I respect these kind of buildings but I really think that in a new millennium when the university is putting itself forth as a as a great research institution and and an institution like uh the stature of Ball State where you were you're promoting your academic life your pedagogy I think it's okay to uh to go for it and to move into the new millennium in new ways same thing at the same attitude as Skidmore College and uh Saratoga Springs New York this is my first clean model it's a building that really defines a bunch of trajectories of of a pedestrian movement of campus movement oops back there I need my tool belt for all this stuff anybody have a tool belt this guy I know you have one okay so the campus housing is in this direction so you could coach the building they're on there's an entry there the library and the main quad is up up here so you approach it and there's an entry here there are actually actual limes times limestone boulders there's sort of glacial anomalies that are on the second erupt in these courtyards so you go past glacial form and boulders between to the building then if you want to go to the pond um which is a great place for lovers you climb over the building and down this long stairway if you want to cut through and go to town which is over here off the page you cut through the building to a little courtyard here and then on through to another path and all the students know so through alleys and backyards to get to town so it's a building this a trap it traps you and it's an interdisciplinary art center called the Tang teaching Museum you might have a seminar conducted by a by an anthropologist an archaeologist a poet in a painter and the idea was to have students rush by that even if they they weren't directly engaged with that with the class and they could at least pick it up peripherally as they move through the building and cut through it and maybe at the same time some art rubbed off on them because that's an art art museum as well as a teaching museum this is a um format for performance piece staged in the uh building was called a settee cage tango and it it's where the audience would do different tasks like this one's what are the plants were were set up here and the audience would become a participant in this interdisciplinary engagement of uh our technology and uh pedagogy interdis- interdisciplinary intention so um the clay model then evolved to this white model and you can see that the the wonderful route up and over the building as you go up and over you can visually eavesdrop into the building into activities that are going on you can cut through at a ground level as as I mentioned and I needed to know about snow so my my time spent skiing my building really helped a lot I learned about snow dams and ice dams and and uh you know cold roofs and all the stuff that you need in snow country and brought it to New York I thought this was a really great thing to to to um bring my kind of my my learning curve to to North Country and not always be associated with the desert I get kind of tired of that being called the desert architect I mean of course it's in my blood it's in my spirit it's my spiritual home but I think regionalism is portable if you do it right when you learn in the desert about winds and Sun and uh the forces that assault a building that's translatable to other places quite readily so that's part of uh part of my pitch when I try to get a project that no more mr. Adobe yeah I can you know I can deal with snow or whatever so here's the descending stairway seen in a couple of different shots and here it is going up and going down there's the pond beyond that's the
