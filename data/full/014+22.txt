my favourite leading men I knew somebody's going to ask me that question um I don't have a favourite because uh there are so many different facets to good actors uh I would say to work with Spencer Tracy was an absolute dream you couldn't do anything that he didn't go right along with you you could stand on your head and he would turn you upside down say you look prettier this way or something you know um Tyrone Power was darling to work with because he he was um my age exactly and uh we had big crushes on each other we did about four or five pictures together I think uh I I loved working with him Clark Gable was marvellous to work with because he he was exactly what you saw on the screen and a wonderful he man who was charming with women uh wonderful with men had a lovely sense of humour I've I’ve never heard him complain about anything I did two pictures with him and uh he was a joy uh Ray Milland was fun to work with and because he he we had a drunk scene he had to play one time and he was worried for two days and I said what are you so worried about and he said well I’m an I’m I when I get drunk and I get mean I'm not very attractive I said well don't just laugh throw everything and that's what he did and I saw the show the other day is not bad at all it's uh pretty good it's not bad the best kisser I didn't answer that did I um I frankly was a little bit in love with every leading man I ever worked with probably because they were all very handsome and and charming and and I was and still am the most romantic idiot in the world and I they dream all the time and so and they're charming on the set and you only see what you want to see anyway you build up all these lovely and it always has a happy ending the scripts that I was in so you get to be a little bit in love with all of them and um there's a general camp that nice to man is nice nice and effective but when you're working uh that kind of a kiss doesn't mean a thing that that's like shaking hands or or or just any kind of a scene it's a scene doesn't mean anything so I can't tell you that question I can't answer it I mean my children were children babies at that time um Christopher was I don't know four as brother was um three and Judy was about eight or nine and we got the first television in Hollywood I'm sure because my husband was a um radio man and he knew that television was there to stay and the motion picture industry it was scared to death of it they should have they had been a little wiser embraced it and owned it and but they didn't they thought it was the enemy and indeed I was advised that if I ever did go into television I'd never get another movie script by mr. Maer whom I liked very much it was a very good friend of mine although I was never under contract to him and David Selznick who was the brother of my agent and uh I think the finest producer we probably ever had he did oh Gone With The Wind and Rebecca and a few of those things that are outstanding anyway we had this beautiful television set in our house and I said wrote with the first night we're going to show it and um as it was a picture a about a suspense picture weren't you know scary one and so the governess came in and then the and then the cook came in I invited the butler in and the gardener people still there came in anyway we had this little audience obviously and and the opening shot is a woman the cameras on her back and opening opening a door and to go into this kind of dark creepy looking room and she takes off her hat and she takes off her coat and as she starts to disrobe that the camera keeps creeping closer and closer and finally it gets up to her head she still got about the camera she turns around like this and you just here take her slip off like this it's in a camera he just see her do this and hands come in choke her and kill her well the children screamed I screamed the cook screamed the gut- we all had a fit and my husband jumped off uh turned off the television and you know it bothered me so because it was right there in our home and I thought oh my lord if this is what we're coming to anything can be on the television well I don't have to tell you anymore it is we all seen today what's on television and it it's frightening I think anyway that's I decided to go into television and uh I called my agents and told them I would like to and they said to well well there isn’t any money in it yet and I said well how long do you think it'll be oh about 10 years I said I'll be dead by 10 years you better hurry up so anyway I want to go into it well they made me wait for two years and then I went into it and I uh I I think this is interesting too for $30,000 a week they gave to me in my company and we made one half-hour show and that paid for everything above the line below the line my salary everybody the music man got more than I did and I was the star uh I work nine years and I I never paid never spent more than the $68,000 for a half-hour show now it's come a far cry from now you're lucky if you can get a television show on the air for two million today anyway I thought that might interest you now oh you really want to hear about that uh coming through the door was charming I was supposed to come in and walk down and to the desk and say what I had to say and Marusia was a designer at that time at uh uh Hungarian she was and wild woman charming and funny and amusing but crazy as a coot anyway she she and she made all the dresses on herself and she had a very gorgeous voluptuous round figure and I was just still like a boy kind of and anyway she she decided she she would do these dresses for nothing and there were um 52 of them a year because I used to redo the the replace on him just so the dresses would be up to date and I love the clothes anyway so she was on the set the morning we were doing this uh first opening with format we called it and she says um anyway I came through the door and I walked down and fine fine fine everything's fine so they started to and I looked over um to light the set I looked over in the corner and she was kind of pouting and I said to her what’s the matter oh she said nothing she said I didn't notice it I never get to see the back of the dress when the whole dress is just draped in the back and I said the back up is the pretty thing front of us just just kind of straight which it was so I thought I said well honey I can't back into the room you know that's kind of look gonna look silly and she's oh I know it I don't mean to crab but I'm just disappointed if I had known that this is all I would have designed a different dress so in order to make her feel better I thought well if I open the door and then turn around and then close the door and then walk down so I I tried a couple times you know and I said hey Marusia watch so I I go through my little step I open the door it turned out to be a pretty good um a trade- uh what do you call it trademark for me that and dinosaur’s kiss I thought were two of the best
