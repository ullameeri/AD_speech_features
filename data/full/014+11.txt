I like them um and I really can only do what I like to do if I try anything else uh it’s not very good I’ve made a Picture with Gary Grant years ago that was written by Jean Arlo and Jean was a beautiful velctuous uh siren uh to say the least uh and uh unfortunately she died and Deryl Sanec called me and said you you you’re gonna do the scrip and I said Deryl I’ve read the script I can’t she said you walk into the room men drop over dead I I I it’s no way I can do this she said you’re an actress you’re gonna do it so I did it and uh the preview came out the review of the preview and the writer said uh I have seen a major motion Picture last night starring Loretta Young and Gary Grant and uh it’s called Born To Be Bad and it is well I wanted to go into television because I felt it was the media so performing because you hit more people uh I used to have uh more viewers on one night than all those 89 motion Pictures put together if they had shown a hundred years well I I of course would be the the last to know who the real one is because I’m too near me um I can see where they could say yes it’s miss Goodie Tushu it’s always kind of made me laugh because uh sometimes I wish I were and and I know I’m not the other one is iron maiden the iron butterfly the steel butterfly uh all these things uh I think there’s a great deal of that in me too otherwise I would not have survived I am in a in an engine in an industry that demands everything from you plus your gratitude um my boys particularly never saw me on the screen until they were about nine and ten I don’t know where they thought I went every morning at four o’clock but anyway um they’re father felt that um he he didn’t want them to see me with any other man but him my son Peter came he’s forty and he came uh about fifteen years ago and he said hey I just saw you in a movie Cheer Gugal fall in love with you I was delighted that was a Picture called The Men in Her Life it was about a ballerina it was pretty too it’s very simple my husband and I are both catholics practicing catholics and the church allows divorce but it doesn’t allow remarriage while the other spouse is still alive very simple no I was very much in love with Spencer for two or three years as a matter of fact we went together for that length of time but he too was a catholic and um we just decided that if it might not last and therefore don’t begin it uh Clark I was never that serious about because he was married and I knew that right at the beginning I didn’t know Spencer was I because he was already separated when I met him but uh in God’s plan they they had their own wonderful lives and uh I lived a a a very nice one after it I think also what happens with a lot of people is that uh the reason a man or a woman remembers that lost love is because they are lost and it is never kind of fulfilled so it is always as in that romantic stage ov promise and mystery you haven’t learnt to fight or get bored or um with each other yet so a lot of that is a kind of a bittersweet story the facts are there yes but it can be over romanticised I think uh anything can happen to anybody uh uh my daughter is uh a a beautiful lovely loving girl uh if for any reason she should decide to write a book then that’s her business uh if she did it would be a nice book I think uh we’ve always been very good friends no I I felt so sorry for Betty Joan at least was gone she didn’t have to live with it but I think poor Betty not till I’m 93 I assure you uh I don’t know uh fortunately all I have to do is live each day at the time and tomorrow will take care of itself this is a uh something that somebody said to me a long time ago and I thought I must remember that thank you for everything in the past and yes to everything in the future
