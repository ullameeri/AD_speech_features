no uh you know perfectly well I do not come on the Johnny Carson show and a jogging suit I just came from a mountain man and as soon as I finish I'm gonna eat my sandwich and go back to the theatre and do the evening preview and this is the kind of thing you wear between shows but I'm not putting down that Johnny I wear a tie so we got that all squared away  that was the proposed scenario well I didn't mind that so much but as we were the FBI fellas came and picked me up at the rehearsal down at the almonds and and as we were racing out to the free route to LAX why they handed me a bulletproof vest and and that made me a little nervous but I must say uh yeah they'd song as they said we'd have to point out to you that you in fact may be the target now of course I really did nothing but sit there for six hours while the FBI negotiators talked to the lady on the airplane on the ground at Kennedy well it was nothing I really made no contribution Johnny honest honest to me but I did did give me an opportunity that I think was valuable to me well a little bit but those fellas are very even they know what they're doing and at a time when the FBI has come under a lot of criticism from people with varying degrees of qualification to criticise man it was interesting to sit there for six hours and watch the dedication intelligence moderation and responsibility with which they ran the whole thing and as a from my situation involved in it and as a taxpayer I was impressed  no leading to real ladies story that there were accomplices at LAX waiting with the note and with undisclosed instructions for me to read a message to the world were an invention but of course they had to take it as was her statement that she had nitroglycerin in her purse you have to assume the worst the worst it was a very nasty situation very unfortunate that that it worked out I think another member of our profession deserves some credit to Teo Bikel uh fine actor Awards on the plane right and he was right in the middle of it and he entertained the passengers by playing his guitar or to keep them Teo Teo paid his due and he got up from entertainer that's great I didn't know that cause I talked to him on the phone he says what are you gonna do he said if I'd been a doctor I would have gone around taking everybody's blood pressures you're supposed do well it's tough Johnny but it's so such a rich piece to work on man for all seasons is there's been no it was written in 1959 there's no play written since I swear that comes close to it it is a more meaningful play now than it was when it was done when Paul Scofield created the pirate went on to do it brilliantly on film but it's a test for an actor but it's a feast for an actor in an audience I I did a matinee it was I'm not tired I'm looking forward to the evening I'm looking forward to the run it's a rich rich piece I've been in then you've got to do all the work different kind of problems different kind of uh responsibilities well a couple of actors have asked me that but all you're risking is your vanity Johnny and maybe that's a healthy thing to do every so often I mean what's gonna happen if if a critic doesn't like what I do is that gonna mean I'm not gonna get a job or something I remember the marvellous thing Laurence Olivier said to me once I did a play with him some years ago and it was a flop and I'm were commiserating with one another when the notices come in and I said well I guess you have to learn to dismiss the bad notices and he said Chuck he said that's easy he said but you have to do this is much more important is to learn to dismiss the good ones well uh I think the nicest uh review I ever had as an actor was not from a professional critic but my second picture was a picture about the circus for sussel B DeMille Jimmy Stewart Dorothy Lamour Betty Hutton Cornell while they were all very good and the circus was marvellous and you know and mr. DeMille showed me a letter after the picture after the Academy Awards you know and all and some woman had written to him and said uh how much he'd like the picture and how good Betty Hutton and Jimmy was were and everything and she said and you know because I played the circus manager in fact and she said you know that circus manager fitted in very well with the real actors too that’s 8 two on Wednesday two on Saturday and Sunday’s off but it's gonna be a rich time I hope a lot of people hope you'll be able
