well thank you no we haven’t we thought we'd give you first crack at it well we both been doing it really for some time Tanya’s been doing I don't know what nine or ten years you see we're not Delta dog was a hit where even when she was 13 and she kind of grew up with it and I did too so it really it really doesn't bother me Tom well you get the same thing too we did just to be away from it really I know look at Reagan he'd say tonight ain’t got a grey hair it is weird it's it's strange we laugh about it all times like uh who knew that we would end up where we are today and where we're going because really saying about Tanya's is such a pleasure she's got big ears and I meant does she hear harmony no yeah it's like like it’s like if I if if I just start singing the songs you can sing harmony with it and her voices are so close the ranges that the blend it's just it just knocks me out on stages to such a place right before I did studio work you know I guess I was singing harmony with Dean Martin on a lot of things uh uh the Beach Boys Rick Nelson is do the background oh that's right after traveling it's uh it's up to you to you and play guitar you know so you get it from both ends and I did make a lot of money doing studio work uh well uh actually it was my new year's resolution for 68 and I fainted a gentleman minded been out and by the time I get to Phoenix have been out but I didn't want to give up the studio work you know you want to make sure you got something here you know like just like you leave in California you know you got something here so you go there and you in yeah it's not this nice to jump look over the cliff now before you take the leap you know but it that was my new year's resolution not to do any more studio work but just to work on Glen Campbell I was very comfortable in it the Tommy produced the show in fact that's how I knew that Tommy saw me on the old Joey Bishop show and I was doing Phoenix and the Gentle On My Mind he cut and I've been I've done their albums I've done three albums with the Tommy and Dickie playing guitar on  and he said Campbell I didn't know you could sing and I said  well you never asked me you know he said can you talk and I said yes he said can you read cue cards and I said if there's not too many big word and it really two weeks later really virtually two or three weeks later we started the Summer Brothers Smother’s show boy it was fun I'll tell you we had some riders Tom Steve Martin Rob Reiner MacLean Stephenson Mason Williams John Hartford Jack Byrnes Avery Schreiber it was just incredible George Yannick Bob Einstein and it was just all I had to do was go out and say hi I'm Glenn Campbell and the rest that was it's getting more resonance in it it really is I'm starting to kind of like the way I sound now well we’d actually never work I never work out the voice it's just like anything else um um really people that vocalize and do that and do all those things  there's a nat there’s a natural way to sing without hurting your voice and if you're taught to sing by mankind then you would have to do all of that but if you have a natural gift to sing I've never localized or done anything before I went onstage the vocal cords are warm they stayed about the same temperature all time never had I think God just gave it gave a gift to sing and why mess with it it's worked so far so good you know we're so good so far no this is backwards but as I just figured why do it because I I've learned to sing without straining my voice it's like Tanya singing the same way I do you push from here and you just the pipes take care of the rest of it I transcendence labels well no everybody doesn’t no like Rhinestone Cowboy it it's across the board easy listening to more um country pop rock or whatever you want to call it I call my music across between country and rock I call it crock for short with Southern Nights the same thing or a Rhinestone uh Gentle Phoenix um I think television did it for me more than anything I don't think I would I would be accepted as widely musically as I am if it hadn't been for television we spent a week in New Orleans and owned up to Natches Mississippi and this left it raw you know and it and Artie Johnson Rita Coolidge and it's it was so it was the most fun show I've ever done outside of yours of course our new single her new single always getting the last word isn’t she best dear that’s the way I used to think too - I think I think I found out the secret of my private life hard about every five years marry a girl you don't like and give her a house I like it there’s a difference between like and love though yeah I in Scotland as for I'm Scotch Scotch-Irish Heinz 57 and I said why don't we get married she said okay and I said now what do I do so we haven't set a date we have and uh yeah I got her drunk no it’s um and um no it would just it just seemed like the right thing to do and we haven't set a date yet but eh we're just gonna kind of play it by ear right I got it cauliflower heart I’ve seen it fail so much you talking about booking a tour or something like that no it was a I did I and it’s the first time I've ever done that and I looked at him yeah he said we got to talk talk to him for two hours you know about everything about how I felt about what I thought about life and uh he said well son I sure did enjoy the visit Tanya and I were raised the same way the same ethnic background and to have someone that knows what you’re doing knows what you're thinking and knows what you've got to do like when you go out to perform if things are going on like before you go on your show if things are going on backstage before you go on and you're upset you know you know how it goes it’s not going to happen we'd both had kind of the same idea about not to you know being within you somebody another person in the business because it would get boring I found it very she swings great Larry weiss wrote this same guy wrote Rhinestone Cowboy I think it's a great song you'll hear it yeah I like I like the love that's what the second verse says you know uh how does it go no a smile how second verse go when you know I'd go blank anyway you're down when you're riding the train it’s taking the long way there is a load of compromising Tom any horizon but I'm gonna be with a lots of shining on me I really like saying that to people I like saying those kind of words to people you know just not just saying oh you broke my heart I'm gonna break your neck type of song  thank you Tom really appreciate it
