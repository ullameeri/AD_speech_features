lovely to see you all it really really is and it’s a wonderful place I got carried away you see they were telling me all about it it's magnificent isn't it I mean the history behind it and and and and who was it who was collecting all that wonderful stuff over the years yeas yeah I mean it's wonderful and I'm you know because I oh I miss the cinema I miss my Betty Gradebook movie all right there we go oh thank you Neil isn’t that sweet thank you very much thank you darling I'm a lucky lady well walking around like this I mean uh I d- well I've been in the business a very very long time it's 62 years I yeah um I I I I I I got my first job when I was 13 in pantomime you know uh ah on the end of the line and I got to say the luck because I was so little and I was on the end of the line I got to say the line like oh here comes the baron you see so that was it you know and I got hooked on uh you know I was I was at a convent I was I won a high scholarship and I I went to a convent and uh but while I was at the convent i used to do little uh tap dancing um little shows you know the local town hall and there happened to be a a um talent scout around looking and he just discovered more common wise and he said to my mother he said your little girl she's got something I think she should go on the stage she should be in pantomime and my mother was a cockney snob you know don't tell anyone who came for the East End and Bethnal Green we're Stoke Newington now which we've we've gone up with you know and so uh and and she was wonderful I understand now why she was like that because it was hard times the war you know and the husband my dad went to war so hard times so and she wanted to better herself it was a new breed of lady and we're not having six kids one is enough you know we might not see our husbands again you know anyway she said to this man my babs go on go on the stage I'll have you know she's going to be a foreign language telephony she won the highest which I did I won the highest at marks in the whole of North London and so so there you go and and then and anyway I ended up going for the audition and getting it and that's how it all started  yeah oh yeah straight away absolutely I mean I will show off I mean but then my entertainment uh was empires my grandad used to take me to the Hackney Empire and the Finsbury Park empire fortunately the Hackney Empire's still there but we're always having to do things to save it to keep it up there you know but uh so I that was my life my grandad used to sing used to sing in the clubs he was a dockage used to sing in the clubs so it was all and he sort of he say you you should have Marie Lloyd you know you should have seen Marie Lloyd you're just like because Marie was little and of course I was fortunate to play her on on on stage in a musical called Singaroo Song but um uh as I say as I did I really got hooked and I uh I was advised to send I'd I’d won this big scholarship at the convent I was a very brainy little thing and uh only as I say only because I went to Blackpool um we got bombed out in Bethnal Green and it was getting too close to the bombs so my mother sent me to Blackpool and I had a wonderful education there whereas most of the schools were closed up here I came back ahead of my head of the the the the class I was in so uh so that's how I got these huge marks and uh but I suddenly once I'd I'd done that bit of pantomime and got on stage that was it and I started playing up at the convent so they released me and my mother sent me to uh she got I mean my dad was bus conductor my mum was a dressmaker and and they had a they got a few quid to send me to a theatrical school called Ada Fosters for just one one term and as I walked in this school I was short fat and loud and the first person I saw on the wall was Elizabeth Taylor and Jean Simmons they'd been at the school and and she looked at me the lady and she Ada Foster and I had all my little certificates that I'd won and all my all my medals you know and she looked my eyes sang for her saying Sunny Side of the Street I always did that Sunny Side of the Street did a cartwheel at the end it always got them I got them in the end cartwheel you know so and Ada and that was it did a bit of tap dancing bit of a bit of ballet and she said um well I don't know what you've got she said because I had this fringe like this you know and all the as I said these lovely girls were there and she said but you've got something she said all those medals all those what you've got mean nothing mean nothing she said she said you might have to change your name she said but there is something about you and I got the pantomime and and then from that I went I used to go to all these auditions and never get them and then when I was 15 I I got an audition for Love From Judy which was a a musical and I was queued up with about oh I don't know about 500 little girls like me and they were all singing I always remember it was the pal- you know the Palace Theater the wonderful palace big palace at Cambridge Circus and the queue started at the stage door and went all the way around that all the way around and as you got closer and closer um I could hear these girls because I I I they were singing songs like um I heard you I've been singing all in that kind of voice you see because I came out and sang “grab your coat and get your hat” and Zippy's acrobat and they liked it you know uh uh people either talked to me or they didn't you know so and I was fortunate to get into that show at the age of just coming up to 15 uh I had to play a 10-year-old and uh and I looked a ten-year-old I didn't have these in those days and uh and of course I I went into this show at 15 and came out when I was 17 and a half I never grew that way very much so I could still play a 10-year-old and you know who's in that show with me the wonderful June Whitfield and June and she doesn't mind me saying this she's 10 years older than me and I used to look up to her think I want to be like her one day a wonderful lady we worked together last week only last week we did a radio show together yeah her new series and um we were trying to think what would sit on on coronation day because we were in the show and uh uh all June could remember she said there was masses of people and we were terrified that we were going to be late for the show and we get fined because there are so many rules in those days I mean I'm appalled the way some of them they call they call their bosses by their real name now you know I mean I wouldn't dream let's say for instance EastEnders they go that we had a boss called Tiedrick and I'd say uh uh good afternoon sir you know how are you and all that but they go oh hello Tiedre hello how's it all going you know that's how they talk well we in those days years ago we were taught to be early and to to be you know be very respectful to the stars of the show I know and and don't get into the lift and you are allowed to get into the lift but I like that I like that that you know I mean June Brown Dot Cotton always says I should give a a master class on how to behave in the theatre because I've kept that people don't think I'm like that they think I'm just but I'm not really I'm and I I I I was taught uh at this particular time when I was in Love From Judy I learned so much in that show it was wonderful that when I if I chose to come into this business and which was part of the public then when I stepped outside the door that was it I was Barbara Windsor because my real name is Barbara Deeks and uh Barbara Ann Deeks but because I was told to change it and that was the years of the of the coronation but also remember I had a family name Ellis my mum's name and Windsor name also my aunt who looked after me while my mother went to work and and I wanted to go for Ellis because of my mum but it was the year that remember Ruth Ellis who got hunged I thought no and of course it was the year of the Windsor and that's how I I chose the coronation anyway sorry I’ve rambled on if you wanna ask me a question oh sorry no no sorry sorry sorry I know I yeah my my old man said to me that he said don't ramble on just give them a chance give it a chance at all but but I I think I think that’s a lot to do with nerves you wanna get you know and um and you want people to I want people to get to see me and look at me and say aren't she little and oh shiny little thing yeah you know and I well I suppose that's how I’ve earned my living really you know but um as I say so that was that so I was in Love From Judy for two and a half years I I uh and about 18 months into the show it we had this terrible terrible um wardrobe mistress so want me to  everybody was very strict she was gonna have fag hanging out of her mouth you know and she said Barbara Barbara Winsor Barbad Deeks or Barber Winsor whatever I wasn't there and she said um she bought this great lump of elastic and she went you're not looking like a ten-year-old anymore she said you look like moulin rouge and these because she had a stick around there and she pushed this all around me so for the last year of the show I had this elastic around my boobs you know I mean so I always had a thing about my my bust you know I used to walk along the street like that you see and of course when I came out the show I'd never had what I call an ordinary life so when's the builder yelled out oh you've seen your feet lately darling I did oh my god what's going on you see so there we go well uh the the thing was what happened I I when I left the show my mother said well you're gonna have to get a job and of course well I was an intelligent girl I didn't have any of the the the certificates and all the you know the things that you have you know to to get a decent job I suppose it's the same now I don't I suppose it is and so I went and worked in a shoe shop which I loved because that was like being on stage because you produced your goo- your goods and you had to sell them to the man and I knew that uh we used to have the ladders then does anybody remember the ladders were in the shop and the men always had the money and I always remember it was the the the the color of the time was sherry tan and sage green and I learned the whole stock like a script but I also learned that the stairs sorry if I went up the stairs like that the men the men paid you see so I did quite well but uh and it was the first time I went to a dance hall like that you know like like a little lady going out and getting a boyfriend and all things like that but it was always always in my mind can you all hear me everyone you couldn't tell me um it was always I wanted I had this I used to audition on Thursday afternoon on my day off and got I got it got into I auditioned for Ronnie Scott because uh so I s- went on the road with him I told my mommy well I am a singer that's yeah but it was so funny because well I'm not anymore but I was but it's funny with one I went to this audition down this terrible little nightclub right in the basement it was in soho and there was five girls and the others were all tall very you know little shares I was still short fat and loud and uh except for I had these and uh he he wasn't like we all got up and sang something the girls got up and did all that stuff did all that jazz stuff and I go up the sang Sunny Side of the Street and he went along the line and he went you little one be at the Mapleton rest- hotel Monday nine o'clock we're going on tour and learn a love of marriage right so I learned love and marriage now of course I didn't have a dress I didn't have oh he said come with a long dress and I had a bridesmaid's dress my mother's a dressmaker so she set up like you do you used to hear one come dancing she sat up all night sewing all these little diamantes and marigolds around like that and and and and pulling it up one of this and  let's see and I went on the road with him which is great but the first thing he did on the first night as I remember it was in Southampton i got and sat next to the the other singer and the guys in the band and said hello to everybody and uh and he and he suddenly walked on and he had his saxophone and he walked and he looked around and he nodded and he came straight over and pulled all the diamonds here the stuff off me said you're hiding the box office Barbara which which kind of makes me think he didn't choose me for my voice you know I mean so there we go so that was good times but I always kept auditioning and um but I was a certain type people either loved me or she's going to be very good for her little parts and things like that so I got yes yeah yeah yeah but I went into that that was great for me absolutely fantastic that that really that worked for me I I my opening night I I I thought nightclubs going on like this at 12 o'clock at night you know I I was really surprised but it was great it was perfect for me I I  absolutely adored it and the first show I ever did all the night clubs years ago and I'm sure some of you will remember they were all different one had a so- solo singer was there one had a comic one had magicians and they this show called Winston's was a little review and and there was vanilla fielding remember the hello that's vanilla you know that's vanilla and Amanda Barry remember she was in connect she was in the show these are all singer dancers Barbara Ferris who was in spark sparrows can't sing with me uh do you remember Jill Gascoigne yes well Jill was in the show you know all not what you know of them for and um and I it they uh it was great it was I used to come out and say what's on in London what’s doing tonight you know that and all of that but I loved it because every night it was different kind of people one night you'd have all the the people from the car the car people would come down you know down to Olympia another night would be all the republicans and all the rest of it you know the new news people other nights it would be all famous you know you'd see victor mature and oh oh look there's Dino Doors and oh look it was a bit it was a bit like that I remember the first time Shirley Bassey came in it was wonderful and I I said she keeps stroking that coat that mink I think it was her first mink stole you know she she said that afterwards I'd never had a mink stole you know and it was all it was a wonderful wonderful atmosphere Alma Cogan all came in you know and I learned an awful lot and I stayed on and off at that show for about four or five years because people would come and go and I would go off and audition and not get the job or get the job and it flopped go on tour for a bit now go back to the club and then one day and every time I used to go off the governor Bruce Brothers used to say uh uh uh our little little lovely lady she's going off let's give her a big applause we want her to be a star because she's going to be a star so I used to get and I used to have a cake and this one time I said to him please Bruce enough already with the cake and the that please let me just go and I went and I never came back so I I went quietly and you know what the show was things than what they used to be I got yeah wonderful show wonderful yeah I know oh how lovely that you picked that out well uh what when I used to do cabaret I used to do uh all the others I should be filming during the day and I was making a film called only little parts not big parts although this was quite a big part right with Jay Mansfield do you remember remember Jay Mansfield well I was doing a film with her I I had quite a nice little part in it and uh it was about a young girl comes to London and gets into trouble and that was me anyway and but it was at a studio which was the big MGM in El street which is no longer there it’s a factory wouldn't you believe you know but it was very most wonderful area because you saw Gregory Peck walking down the street Robert Mitchum it was fantastic and where we were making this film um they were making uh another film another film and it was with Anthony Newley uh and Bernie Winters you know a few few names and I used to meet them at lunchtime because I Anthony comes from Hackney and so did I so I used to rabbit you know and unbeknown to me he they were looking for somebody to go into things saying what they used to be to play this Irish prostitute they cast it all except for this one part and Bernie was with Lionel Bart who wrote it and um he said I can't find anyone for this girl can't I so but uh Bernie said well there's a funny little girl he says she's making this this this um movie with Jay Mansfield she comes and tells these surrender stories about Jay Mansfield I used to go and tell her all the gossip I was going yeah never guess what well you know why she used to want how she used to uh uh peg her things so and all the angles ha to go that way with the cameras and we never got a looking so I used to go no no um um um I was terrible I was very naughty and now as they anyways he said you want to get her in she's fantastic Lionel said well I know her she's a singer he said that was it so I got invited to audition for things and what they used to be and that's the note the very notorious story of me and Joan Littlewood how I met Joan Littlewood yeah and and and shouldn't have been should not have been I was everything that Joan wouldn't like because because of my upbringing in the theatre I you know I I would if I arrived somewhere I'd know my script it would be marked up I knew everything always dressed nice no jeans and well they didn't have jeans in those days but you know always looked nice Joan was totally different and when they asked me to go and audition it was on a Saturday morning and I was at Winston still and I remember taking a nice skirt with me to wear and a nice top and I arrived it was on Saturday morning at the Wyndham's theatre and i arrived at the Windham's and I only knew Joan that she'd done um what was that uh no no she'd never done no that was much much later uh but what's the one I'm looking for taste of honey that was the one so her name was was big you know but and I'd seen a couple of things kind of about her but she wasn't the kind of person I would like to work for because I would I was used to working with people like the Emile Littlers those big producers who brought in these great big shows into the West End you see so uh and I used to boast a lot about my West End career I know I know I was a pain in the jacks here I really was playing in the arts anyway so I arrived at this oh dear pissed again I mean there's always one can't hold their drink can they that's that do you know who that was that was Joan say you cow you're going to tell that bleeding story about me anyway she was there was I arrived at the stage door at the Windows theatre and there was a lady's kind of sitting on a stool with uh her legs like that with a fag and there was a bucket and a mop and she was doing like around that and I came she went oh hello I said hello so what you come for what are you doing here so I said oh I've come for this audition I said I’d I I worked till three o'clock last night I said but I don't really wanted to come to it but you have to because your agent says this is you know I I just rambled on and she said I said what are you doing sure I'm just cleaning this stuff I said all my nan’s a cleaner and she works at Pims the the drink factory I said then she you know and then just talked like that and then suddenly I went in oh and she said what she said what are you doing you're early so I said yes well I'm always early you know and I I started on about about my West End shows I you know anyway god loves her I’ve I I you know I'm like I've done you see and the way I was brought up you see I mean you know uh and um anyway I I um I walked onto the stage and it's like you when you're in the theatre you can't see anybody it's all dark and you hear a voice and it was Lionel Bart's voice and yeah hello and I knew him he said well hello it's Lie here I said hello so he said you know this is for things and what they used to be it's a player Irish prostitute I said oh I can't do Irish because I didn't really want to I didn't want to go to Stratford East my mother’d worked very hard to get us out of the East End and and you know so I that was it and I was I was I a terrible little snob at that point uh uh uh and I’d go and I was honest and of course  and there was another man there called Jerry Raffles I didn't know who he was and then I could hear this woman's voice and she said well wait wait wait uh I said oh I can't do an Irish so she said well where'd you come from so I went in this whole thing again about how I was actually from the east end but my mother worked very hard and I now live in Stoke Newington where they vote liberal I mean I don't know now that was it you know now yeah so it was all these silly so she said okay so she said well uh what you guys I'm doing nightclubs so do you ever see any of the prostitutes because they were still on just about going off the street then so I said oh yes yes I do and I you know so she's all right do a do a kind of a cockney prostitute so I thought what a ridiculous audition because normally they just say hand you your music da da da da what have you been doing it was nothing like that so I I walked up and down oh don't I'm going to show you I walked up and down hello have a short day mister please forgive me listen no I'm really sorry and I but that that was it enough and and I heard a little bit of laughter and I was just I didn't want the job and I just walked up and down doing this you see all these terrible things and laughed and I could hear Lionel who was really on my side I knew that and this voice and she said can you sing I said yes well actually I am a singer and I've wheeled off my pa all my stuff again oh god don't I'm but so she's all right could we have a song so I I  picked up my music and my dots they called them and I went to the pianist but there was no pianist and I said oh where’s the piano where's the pianist she said if you're such a great singer you don't need a pianist so I got up and I I sang I thought this this is mad this is sang sunny side the street finished with a cartwheel well I thought I'm never going to get this one never going to get this audition and I had an attitude and I'm very ashamed of myself I had an attitude I didn't want to do this but really because of my mum was instilled with me West End West End West End get out of the East End get out of the East End don't ever say you come you know from the East End and next thing this woman came on this woman who sat with a hat and the thing you know and I looked it and I said hello so she said my name's Joan Littlewood you're Barbara Windsor where have you been all my life and that was it and I I I just couldn't believe it cause so anyway I started rehearsals I hated it I hated it so much I ran away almost because because I arrived on the first day with everything marked up at theatre workshop theatere world show uh Miriam Carlin remember the great Miriam she was she was the only other one who hadn't worked with her before and everybody else she called her nuts and they all came schlocking in you know me and there was me and Miriam sitting there you know and the first thing she did there was Lionel and and there was Frank who'd written the book and heard she said oh there are you're all my new nuts aren't you she said I've got a few old nuts over there and I said that are you all ready yeah yeah that's good I'd marked everything as I walked there and come back here and she said yeah excuse me again but when you talk about Joan she swore at the time she said what a load of fucking rubbish and I went what she said nah don't want to do this do we chucked it in the air oh my you know that's how I anyway to cut a long story short I didn't like the way she worked at all and I didn't like the swearing all the time because I never swore you know I didn't like all that and things like oh we don't don't play with that part don't do this part go and learn what she's doing learn her lines ah I don't know I want to learn my lines you know and and that was it and I I fell out with her and she told me to F off back to the west end where I was used to working and I went to see my agent and he laughed and he said look she's she's she's crazy this lady but believe me try and stick with it so I I did and I and I thought I'll go and look at Soho because this is all based in Soho so I'm going to look and I looked and I'm seeing that all the girls who were going off the street were putting up different labels like massaging done here you know blonde or brunette weather and and French lessons and even cleaning lessons cleaning they would go come and clean your house and all that I thought ah they've gone on so I came back with these ideas and who hasn't walked through the door she was there she went oh got over your tantrum have you seen a bit yeah yeah i didn't have your West End have you all like that I said yeah yeah and that was it and then three days before we opened I kind of got into it a little bit you know three days before we opened she said uh little bird she used to call me little bird see come here she said um me and Lionel decided that you should do a song well a song how what what kind of a song is it going to be comedy is it going to be this that I asked hold on she said we're going to give it right he's written you a little song he's going to play it for you in a minute and he did and I said there's going to be any choreography look all I want you to do is sing the song sing your song sing on a sit on the stool sing the song oh and I said to her where's it coming because it's in the second act it's better where's it coming so she said about 15 minutes in the second act I felt myself go oh that's great that's great let's hope I can do big cartwheels and all things like that that was going on in my brainbut anyways she said anyway I just want you to learn it and do it and I'm going to have to swear again I do apologize to the ladies and the gentleman but she said but she said uh but that's Joan it’s it’s it's Joan that's the way she was and she walked off the stage and she turned back to me she said oh before we go any further when you sit on the stool for fuck sake sit on those fucking hands because have you gathered I do this and so on the first night I sat like that where do little birds go to in the winter time I stopped the show and we went to the West End and we ran for nearly three years so yeah she changed my life she changed my life absolutely yes yes  it did it got great reviews I mean there was a lot of critics didn't like the show because they they liked the Oklahoma's like I did and carousels we love those musicals and this was like this is like 10 actors with a few old props you know and so uh but it worked it was of the time it was homosexuality was being accepted uh the the the the prostitutes were going off the streets so it was of a time and it was um what was the furniture of that time I can't remember oh what daddy yes was she planned furniture not all not all uncut marquette you know that was all going and uh and saying things ain't what they used to be it was so perfect so we ran for two and a half years it was a big big big success but we got that two or three critics really slaughtered it but the majority of people but we also had a hit song two things than what they used to be although we used to sing rude rude lyrics in the show yeah but Max Spygraves pulled out a clean version so there we go you know so that changed my life  can i just tell the story yeah about two years later um they wanted Joan to do a film the you know the producers who owned our show and she sparrows was not a hit they put on sparrows to play and it wasn't a hit she said I want to do sparrows wouldn't you know what she what could do things a hit which was a big hit no she wanted to do sparrows so she said she wanted to do sparrows and she wanted me to play the leading lady with Jimmy Booth and they didn't want me the producers they said no no no she's very good with her sweet little funny little lady parts but not for the leading lady at the park she said well either you have her or I don't do it so so that was it so so they got me and we did the film it was very hard we did mostly on location but we were fortunate we had Ronnie and Reggie Craig who stood who put their their minders up so we could film you know and filmed in their clubs and things like that and that's how I get associated with them more for that you see you know so anyway so that that so that was that now everything was nice the film was made and then Lionel said can I see a print of it
