Ray Charles and um Billie Holiday see I got and I gotta work tomorrow in um Jones Beach 1954 I guess it was Los Angeles with Jeany Odus one is downtown and one is uptown the difference between blues and jazz one is downtown and then those jazz guys took it uptown it’s the same thing well it’s kind of like in um the fifties when rock ’n’ roll there was rhythm and blues and when rock ’n’ roll came along was like it was the same thing it was it was blues then and then and it was pulled from that and now it’s just that everybody’s intensifying the blues and making it really fun of my songs I guess Sugar On The Floor I can’t think Sugar On The floor is my the main one that I can relate to well I think that’s the thing because it was like um women are like supposed to be too pretty and too cool too nice and housewives and things it’s just like in the old days when they said that woman women couldn’t smoke but now it’s like it’s kind of like a women’s l- at least I’m a I’m gonna fem- I’m a feminist I’m not like carried away but I like to do anything that a guy does and that way um I can sing songs about getting knocked down in drug I can sing a song about hitting a guy across the head with a beer bottle stuff like that well he’s right um but electronic instruments are needed now for one thing because of high tech sound but for us no synthesizers and things  that only puts too much toys and too much um techniques in it you know what I mean technical things but you gotta have it you gotta have it because you gotta have your sounds gotta be up to date you can’t sound like you came from the thirties or the forties you gotta talk about the same things and um you  know blues to me is like it’s like a spiritual feeling is what happens everybody feels good do you know spiritual feeling with the down-home message and usually people can really relate to that the like that I mean they will come out of the closet for that like you can say hey you feel like breaking up somebody’s home somebody real cool and nice will go oh how dear you say that but I mean it’s the truth people think about it every day just I talk about the things that are real I’m not gonna say fly me to the moon and let’s dance among the stars I’m gonna say you know hey let’s meet in the hallway in Stop Six Motel and get it on right Billie Holiday and Ray Charles yes
