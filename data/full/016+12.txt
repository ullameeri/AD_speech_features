well Kevin this is the first time I've been back since Kevin's uh I mean since Tamika's retirement ceremony which was really a fantastic night uh but I I'm able to watch the WNBA games on uh WNBA dot-com and then I've I’ve got the package the uh uh and then the ESPN three so I I see a lot of the games so I really keep up with it I've been busy at Kentucky but it's easy to pull up the games and easy to to still follow the team well we always knew sue was going to be really really special in this league because she'd already had such an outstanding college in high school career uh I think the thing that surprised all of us is that she's held up physically so well she's taking such great care of her body uh not only has she played five hundred games but I believe she just became the all-time assist leader uh I think she's probably gonna break some other records before she finishes and she looks great she's taking care of herself uh and I think she's the real reason why this team is probably back in uh in contention for uh the top spot well the interesting thing about Tasha is uh it's been a journey for her you know she's with the Fever and then she was with Minnesota Lynx and now in her fifth year uh I think you see her kind of grow into her body her uh understanding the length of speed that the gifts that she's got and she's playing extremely well she wasn't selected as an all-star but she certainly is having an all-star season well you know Klop was uh my assistant in Seattle we were built that team we were an expansion team and he comes from a long line of of of great basketball mentors his father was a with the Sonics and and he's just a great friend but he's also a great coach he's a tremendous defensive coach uh and I think see I was very fortunate I'm Dan Hughes was tickled that he was able to keep Klop on his staff uh and I can see Klop’s defensive schemes uh in the Seattle system exceptional rookies um you know I I I’ve coached against all three of them  in uh SCC and then in um MCE tournament uh I was thrilled when they were able to get Kelsey Mitchell prolific score just has a tremendous upside um and then of course um um Mapongo was a teammate of hers um and and I think you know just so has any posted they tended to develop a little a little later and then wash I'm a great fan of Vivian's uh you know we we tried to defend her uh in the SEC but she's just uh you know she's a combo player she played the two three four she can hit the three she can thrive and she's got like you know a big strong body uh so I really think all three of these rookies uh are the future of the of the Fever well I’m done I still have for me to retire I I am just speedy she my fourth uh year with the University of Kentucky in some capacity I I I'm now I'm going back as a as a consultant I was a full-time assistant for two years and I'm gonna be a consultant this year and then I'm gonna try to retire after this year and go to Florida it's time well thank you I love being back here I love these Fever fans they're always the best
