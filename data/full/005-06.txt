yes eh Janet was cast in touch of evil after I of course was on it and Orson was directing it and uh I think the interesting story is that uh Janet broke her wrist uh not long before we started which that makes it very complicated but they uh put a detachable cast on her and she wore a a I forget whether it was a sweater or a blouse that covered it and it must have she must have been in some pain but she never never complained and uh if it was a very close angle they would even take the cast off and then of course in the course of the shoot she recovered but I always admired that uh as a sterling sterling example of professionalism well you mean you wanna do that again well just before shooting began in the film Janet I believe working on another film uh fell and broke her wrist and of course she had to have a cast on it which severely complicated the shooting but she was very gutsy about it she never complained though she must have been in some pain and um when for example they were doing the scene in the motel where she's in her a slip and obviously had bare arms they even took the cast off uh which must have been even more painful but she never um made any objection and that was a good example of professionalism well of course if you remember the film we’re separated during most of the film we don't have many scenes together after the first scene with a car blows up the the what is still described as the greatest Chapman boom shot in the history of movies uh which could be done easily now with a Python boom you don't even need an operator on the in the camera but em that was am am technically very difficult and required complex um timing and took all night to shoot and and actors are used to working all night but again um actresses sometimes are not used to working all night at least not making a movie and uh Janet never uttered a word of complaint was always as I've never seen her otherwise uh good-humoured uh outgoing uh available and professional I um myself came into film a little later than that um after the in essence the studio system was over uh em Janet must have been one of the last fruits of the classic studio system that prevailed through the 30s and 40s and uh I can well imagine why she is clearly uh the camera loves her that's this is people don't understand that uh it doesn't have a lot to do with acting ability though that's useful or beauty or handsomeness though that's useful depends on whether the camera loves you and the camera love Janet obviously and that was uh she was clearly it would be signed by the first major studio that saw her um the casting in uh Touch of Evil was unusual casting for her and somewhat of a surprise to the rest of us and the fact that she fell so readily into a a much darker kind of film than she had done there too for I think um shows her flexibility I think it was the studio's choice which Orson recognized as a as a good idea I didn't have approval on that casting and wouldn't have objected to it in any event well the system was still in place well I guess Marlon was the first to have a an independent contract and as far as I know I was the second but when I came here to do my first pictures uh the system was still in place everybody at all the studios was under contract directors writers producers actors actresses of course the okay me the studio system has been much maligned it's true that you were firmly in the grip of the studio you did what they wanted you to do and if you disagree that puts you on a suspension um the advantage of the studio system was that you got a lot of what baseball players call at-bats by the time if you made a lousy picture by the time it was in the theatres you'd make two others Hank Fonda told me that uh the year he made grapes grapes of wrath' he also made drums along the Mohawk um Abe Lincoln in Illinois and a small part in a musical that's the same year and you got a lot of experience now you didn't have the independence those of us who came up in the independent era but that may have been good for me and 15 actors and seven actresses and nine directors and four writers but I suspect maybe there was a lot more opportunity in the 30s and 40s for a lot of actors and directors and uh writers you hadn't even your wife well that's true of film actors in general even today when they almost most of them at least have had some television experience which is film after all now um it and for the women it must have been a difficult time because their casting was limited they were always uh standing beside the male lead usually with his arms protectively around her and uh waiting waving in the background while he wrote off to do battle against the forces of evil and that's limits your opportunities I think probably one of the major changes in film is the widening opportunity that has been um available to actresses to do different sorts of roles I remember certainly arguably one of the very best films I ever made was a um little western called will penny and it has aside from being a marvellous film it has the best woman's part I have ever seen in a Western wonderful part and we thought we can get anybody we want for this part and um we offered it all around town to all the hottest actresses that were there and had terrible trouble casting it we eventually cast Joan Hackett who course gave a performance that no one could have equalled but later on I realized why we had so much trouble because the opening paragraph of description of the character in a film script when a character first appears you have two or three or four lines describing what she's like and this said um the woman is clearly intelligent somewhat playing and I can see actress saying bye-bye but so you know that that wouldn't happen that would but then if if you were a beautiful woman and almost all the women who were stars were beautiful um you played beautiful women and um the part in will penny was not such a character but Joan understood that and I think more and more that was maybe one of the first examples of that then I remember there was some uh excitement amazement dismay pick any of the four going three when we cast a a very good black actress uh Rosalind Cash uh opposite me and Oh Mega Man which was um I'm not certain it was exactly a first but it wasn't far from a first for a black actress to play a romantic lead well it is true that even today it's harder for a woman there are fewer parts um more actresses competing there are more actresses than there are actors and their career spans seem shorter uh what the reasons for that are who can say well I did the picture with uh with Jane it wasn’t a very good picture but it was uh she had a strong role in it she was uh the founder of a department store chain as I recall and as I said it unhappily it wasn't a very good picture but that wasn’t that wasn’t Jane’s fault yeah well that's it it was uh kind of a fluffier sort of story I guess uh there's whether that was my fault uh that it didn’t work is an is an open question certainly that it it was the kind of role that rocked dead well to to explore that um probably true comment you want to go back another ten years to Norma Sure Joan Crawford and Betty Davis and when they really were there was a time in the 30s when I remember George Brett saying it's marvellous all I have to do is have my hair cut because all you see is the back of my head in those pictures with Betty Davies  but um and Greta Garbo of course but that and Claudette Colbert but that was uh another time and I'm I'm not an expert witness to it I did um two films with Eva even towards the end of her career and she still was just stunning probably arguably at least arguably the most beautiful woman in film you could say well Garbo I guess you'd have to say Garbo and Jennifer Jones a couple of others but here it gets to be a very short list and uh I did the problem with stunning beauties of that level is that a lot of them and I think I can fairly say this available because I worked with her twice a lot of them believe in their heart of hearts that their beauty is the only reason they're hired now Eva wasn't a bad actress but she thought she was she was perfectly competent actress but she was you go I give you Marilyn Monroe you whom you could hardly get in front of the camera and Monroe was certainly the last of the great studio uh actresses studio stars and they were abused mishandled uh treated as uh sex toys by the studio heads uh it was a a bad situation again this was a little before my time but we we are aware of it yeah and the Eva showed the scars as much as any of them did and I I never worked with Munroe I turned down a part with Monroe because I'd I'd heard about how difficult she was to work with not that she made scenes but she just didn't show up if if she's not there you can't do the shot  Jimmy Stewart Gary Cooper guys are like that Hank Fonda wonderful guy wonderful I was very fortunate early in my career to work with men like that and directors like DeMille and Lydia and Wyler and Stevens uh em what she seemed on the screen bouncing betty hutton you know she was fine now and tripped on the edge of the rink yeah no he no he said hey well  Chuck it can only get better from here well that's of course a different point well Jennifer to the best of mine only actress I've ever worked with who didn't wear makeup no kidding didn't wear makeup and she was and still remains a stunning beauty and uh she was very edgy and uh nerve she would never look at his still of herself uh she didn't want to see the stills and uh em but she was very professional new the words on time ready to work all that stuff but in a scene where we were supposed to be I was quarreling with her and uh she hit me as she was supposed to and uh she was quite a big lady you know she's not short and very strong and uh she uh almost knocked me down and that's with uh with one back hand and broke her hand  she was fairly private woman I guess you're supposed to be politer to women oh if um in some of my earlier films uh though I had the best part I was working with stars of some magnitude like Jennifer and uh uh Eleanor Parker and susan hayward and of naturally their deferred to their the star now that's there's nothing unusual about that well to this day Los Angeles is not really a city it's just a series of contiguous communities one of them being the film community I'm not certain the film community has changed vastly except that it's not dominated by television but other than that I wouldn't say I think during the studio era when almost all the movies were made here and actors and actresses would and directors would often pass their whole careers at on studio MGM or fox or paramount and then there was a great deal more socializing but the time I came in they technically could make pictures on location uh make them better and cheaper and so on and did so that kind of fragmented what probably was uh what Janet is described as the social structure of the studio era which uh while it was still in existence when I came I didn't uh I remember they must have invited everybody in town because we were very new in town and uh we were invited to um Marion Davies a party Marion Davies gave and if we were there any everybody was there and the feature I remember most is in the front hall was a an Egyptian sarcophagus a real Egyptian sarcophagus about 8 feet by four feet by four and a half feet filled with cracked ice and Nebuchadnezzar's not magnums Nebuchadnezzar's and I said okay this is a Hollywood party and they had naked girls falling into pools and so on but uh that was really my only exposure to that kind of party that was yeah the last of the Hollywood parties maybe
