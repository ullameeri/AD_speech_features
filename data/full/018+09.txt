well um yes I'm afraid now you've raised this question I shall have to um say a lot of rather depressing things um I mean of course I love many cities and I know splendid things have gone on in them but ever since they've been around they have eaten up the territory around them haven't they um I mean it's striking our people find a city like Angkor Wat a great ruin abandoned in this forest and they say oh dear why can anybody have abandoned so vast and splendid a city and what turns out is that such cities eat are all the territory around they use up all the crops and they use up all the wood until in the end they collapse um and I suppose in a way one night say this isn't tragic it's just part of life everything is impermanent as a Buddhist rightly point out and that sorry am I going a bit fast I mean it's not only Angkor Wat of course all over the Middle East the ruins of cities have been found which have apparently eaten up their surroundings in the same sort of way um if some sort of break could be put on the growth of cities I suppose something could be done about it and of course over the centuries a lot of cities have gone on at a reasonable size and a reasonable the pace and haven't done this um Athens is still there there the Athenians are doing their best to uh get rid of it in the same sort of way um but um now that the extent to which we can eat up is so greatly enlarged that we can eat up the resources from the whole earth and not just to find us it's rather hard to see how unfortunate Gaia who is a big hospitable hostess and has done her best over many centuries for the animals that produce this kind of effect it's extremely hard now to see how Gaia can continue this service and that's my first thought and I'm sorry as I say if it's not a very jolly one yes well um I'm always fascinated by our continuity with the whole of the rest of the biosphere um and this is a very interesting case of it because right from the beginning of life a whole lot of self-organization has had to go on hasn't it and people um who studied the origin of life are now pointing out how uh what looked like very modest molecules managed to organize themselves into successively into more and more complex checks until bing one day it's alive um I think it's not a sort of sud- sudden frontier um and then they get more and more complex and once there's been one day it's conscious but I'm not sure that that one's so sudden either we don't know whether insects are conscious um to my mind consciousness is just a more extreme form of life so to speak I mean life is highly organized activity and as it gets more and more organized it kind of reflects on itself I don't feel that something quite separate came in when consciousness did although that used to be the official view um and then when you get your people um they organize themselves uh and bing one day it's a city uh now again it's a continuous process isn't it uh and a very fascinating one and um I mean in uh being gloomy at the start about the future of cities I don't want to underestimate for splenders which those cities have um shown over the the many centuries um it has to be it has to be like an organism doesn't it and at first it is quite like an organism in that all the parts have to agree more or less uh but of course already in ancient Athens that's getting less true it's a democracy but not the women and not the slaves and the the consent of all is being asked in rather special kind of way the larger it gets the harder it is for this story about self-organization to be true isn't it um if one asks is London organizing itself well in a sort of our way uh that is the people all the people in it it have some sort of indirect control but it's very hard to make it really work um I mean the cities that we admire most today I guess are those of which that is most true that is the where they all the members all the parts are mo- most able to take part and where the decisions aren't taken regardless of everybody else this is again my first thought about uh cities and self-organization does that make sense yes well it's still the same London but like all cities now the traffic is bloody awful I cannot uh modify my views about this I just hate it um I live in Newcastle which is also an ancient city and is also pretty good except there's too much traffic um I don't know if there's any way of as it were training oneself to rejoice in this and seeing it as one more uh you know splendid carbonyl activity but that doesn't come very natural to me apart from that yeah um now when I the only time I really lived in London was early in the lo- second world war uh when I was civil servant actually I was living in kingston but I was working in London came up to London every day um often spent my lunch hour looking at the city churches which I am particularly fond and thinking well I hope we can keep that one but in red I've seen some Lawrence jury now you know if it does happen to go um with a great appreciation uh the uh thing that bothers me now you can't hardly find those churches if you haven't got a map you see before it was all towers they stuck up as they always had done you can see that this was a city to which the churches were fairly important now it's the banks you know no mistake it's a city where the banks are the most important thing uh but of course that's how life is um things have to change and then I don't get to cross about it and I wish to put up a psalm of joy about the London parks um this one's lovely and the other day my sons and I were sitting in Green Park in the evening and it is absolutely gorgeous and what we owe to those Victorian people who fought for those parks cannot be exaggerated I think a city without parks is dreadful I was in Sao Paulo once I don't know if anyone else here has had that appalling experience San Paolo though it's very old has been built absolutely continuously house next to house someone I knew had a house in San Paolo San Paolp that did have a garden then everybody was saying to them when are you going to build on that plot you know uh that we have in done from the city which is not like that it seems to me uh endless calls for delight  oh well what angle should I go from I mean I suppose there's two angles I could say something about Gaia and religion um what I'm actually working on at the moment is trying to understand the theory of intelligent design um and that has made me aware as I was not before of how much the American attitude to religion is influential in politics at present that may be rather a political topic you like that one well uh yes um where will I start yes well um I mean I knew that this was being put forward as a sort of compromise uh between uh the creationist feel that the whole of the Bible is literally true uh and some kind of modern science um and I knew that the modern scientists say sorry charm it hasn't worked um and I found that still to be true the more they are investigated um but the interesting thing is why it is being attempted um I did not realize how far the American public is and has always been deeply dedicated to that biblical story um particularly to the literal interpretation of Genesis and also to the Book of Revelations which is much worth because it's prophecy um and the book of Revelation says there will be a thousand years when Christ will rule that will be at the end of everything now it seems that the a great mass of the American people have a view of this which is really not common over here which is um that Christ will only rule after um the end of the world as it were there will come a terrific catastrophe and Armageddon and a lot of war only after that can Christ come and rule and the only thing to do before that is to um make oneself um um um suceda one's own salvation so um the kind of American sects I mean an enormous number of Protestant sects emigrated to America because they were not welcome in Europe or thrown out and so forth and these extreme Protestant views that the Bible's terribly important um and what the Bible said was there will be this frightful Armageddon and so forth so anyone is wasting their time who now dedicates themselves to try to in to improve things the idea that by improving things you could bring about this wonderful thousand years is held to be a heathen um and pagan and very unsatisfactory um all you can do is wait um and the notion of the rapture which has come up quite lately that you will be wrapped up to heaven if you are saved uh really is pretty influential I'm sorry I'm going to sound a bit alarmist about this but I'm feeling a bit alarmed um a lot of Americans of course don't believe a word of this any more than most of us do but they do tend to be on the East Coast in the North or in large cities they tend to be intellectuals and these are suspected deeply suspected by um the millennialist people um I mean the figure which is sticking in my mind and I'll stop after that is that when asked what sort of science should be taught in schools forty-five percent it seems I will reply um either di- direct creationism or intelligent design which is supposed to represent it um forty forty percent yes no sorry 40 45 simple say direct creationism forty percent will say uh intelligent design and you and you can teach that's right of you could teach both you can teach ordinary evolution and intelligence on twelve percent only will say that ordinary evolution of the kind which every uh paid-up scientist believes in should be taught um this is a gap um and it's a political and immoral gap much more than an intellectual gap I think that's a gap of the tribes that people seem to belong to so I'm not sure if I'm talking about religion really when I talk about this um because I think it's i- i- it's it's a strange form of religion and I certainly want to say that Christianity as such doesn't call for this at all my father was a Parson uh who had no question about uh evolution thought was perfectly all right have always had um and you know in in in fact in 1980 when the state of Arkansas passed a law saying that um evolution should not be taught in schools there is prosecuting the state of Arkansas were the American civil liberties and 12 theological bodies only one scientific body bothered there's there's an awful difficulty I think about people talking to each other understanding what each other are doing because it is this great tribal divide um and I I think it is very bad now um that people like Richard Dawkins are really identifying Darwinism with atheism well yeah I mean I'm often in trouble for having been a bit sharp with him and he's been sharp with other people so I don't feel too bad about that um I think it's like this that he has done a monumental and very good job of showing the continuity of humans with the rest of creation that the same sort of uh natural selection and other processes that have made us have made all the other creatures and we are really part of that continuum this is terribly important to me and I think very highly of it um and I think he has done that very well and got it through to many people uh he's gotten view about genetics which is uh in the view of many geneticists a bit one-sided and extreme namely that its genes that the selection is among and not uh groups or individuals but that doesn't matter so much what really bothers me is the rhetoric the language of selfishness and investment um because people pick that up inevitably in its ordinary everyday meaning he says it'd only a metaphor but metaphors are terribly important especially the sort of dominant noisy metaphors that you put on your covers uh the idea that the genes are selfish is not in fact compatible with uh individuals being selfish the idea is that your genes will make you unselfish if that will cause you to having more children and therefore uh to become a prevalent uh trend in evolution uh so in in principle it shouldn't mean that at all but uh people do take it that way and as the the age was in any case greatly prejudiced in favour of selfishness you know it highly individualistic sort of age this wasn't what need people needed saying um and people do identify identify evolution itself with uh with selfishness with the uh sur- um survival of the fittest in the sense that everybody's out for their own end and nobody ever bothers about anybody else um and he has um himself often used the word in that sense and and it's not only him of course it's the socio biologists generally um but I got very excited when that first book and selfish gene came out and I wrote an article about it I've not done it again a very cross article which by no means fair to Dawkins um but I do think that you see individualism is terrible danger to us because we really have they we've had excellent things out our gate since the Enlightenment lots of individual freedom and uh regard for each person on their own if you carry that too far you lose the whole um communal sense the social uh glue that binds us the the sense of the importance of the hell um and I'm sure that we have fallen too far that way well it isn't a religion in the sense of being a sect with temples and priests and uh uh 10 commandments it is it's not meant to be like that at all and the word Gaia um is used to mean the earth considered as a self-maintaining whole a continuous being of which we are all part uh when James Lovelock invented that idea he found people didn't understand it very well he complained of this to his friend William Golding the novelist uh and I think he said I want to fall at a word William Golding said why don't you call it Gaia uh which is the ancient Greek goddess of the earth but there never has been any suggestion of putting up temples it's just that I think the parental idea the idea of it as our parent uh got through to people imaginatively and they then were able to pick this up um there's all sorts of difficulties but I think you see that when the Greeks regarded the earth as the mother of their gods another of God's men they were taking an attitude to it which is a very proper attitude that we wouldn't express it like that today it's about a matter of all gratitude reverence for something much greater than us of which we are part um and you see it really does correct the sort of idea that's been around since the 17th century that matter is inner stuff uh just a billiard balls little blogs you know it's bang off each other and we bring in the spirit which causes all the movement that contemptuous really attitude to the rest of nature is what we have been brought up with though we haven't noticed it as much as we should have done and I think that the imagery of Gaia is a a good in so far as it correct that it really isn't a matter of setting up except oh absolutely yes yes yes days and I've spent an awful lot of incan time uh saying so I mean the idea that there is no such thing as human nature um was part of a grotesque exaggeration that the behaviorists made that that you know that everything was due to society where words society come from you know social conditioning got to be somebody doing it and we are an animal like uh other animals with a marked no emotional constitution on top of that of course we do have an awful lot of culture we do uh have much more um complex and interesting ways of kind of guiding and shifting and shaping this in the course of our lives um than most animals do and that is of course terribly important but that isn't the side that has been exaggerated I mean Marx similarly it said there wasn't any such thing as human nature meaning that it's economics that does it all well similarly you know uh what's economics uh the behaviour of men in markets um people people are people are there behind all that um yes I mean I have does made a lot of effort in a book called beast and man and everywhere else um to make people feel alright with the idea of human nature to say that it's not a um an oppressive kind of idea freedom is quite compatible with our having a natural Constitution indeed if we didn't have any natural Constitution we presumably wouldn't have the motives to uh cause us long to be free you know and um it's it's to to get rid of that conflict has been I think my main writing at interest
