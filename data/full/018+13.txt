um well it's delightful to be invited to come to the RSA and I um look forward to um a good bit of discussion I'm told I don't have to talk for 45 minutes but for a short time and that suits me much better um this is a book about individualism um and it is written out of intense um indignation and exasperation um with the kind of individualism which is being sold today under the name of Darwin it's not what Darwin said um but that on its own uh wouldn't be my business I'm not a Darwin scholar um but I think that the state of individualism is a worry to all of us um and it's good to get it straight um you see I think if one means by individualism the reg- reg- regard to separate individuals instead of just to the mass um this has of course been a splendid contribution of the enlightenment uh something that we probably all uh think terribly highly of and very important um but like a lot of things uh it's one individualism is something you can have uh too much of if you go on in the direction in which you have started to um change society cutting everybody off more and more from everybody else uh forgetting about the communal side of life uh you get into a great mess um in private life private life tends to lose meaning um and public life of course doesn't work so well this is a cliche stuff uh but somehow we seem to have been forgetting it um darwinism is now used as the name for this kind of thing um people think of Darwin as having um insisted that evolution only works by competition and the survival of the fittest and dog eat dog and so forth well it so happens that in the descent of man Darwin far from this had a very interesting view about how we are social creatures and like other social creatures um naturally cooperative and friendly even though of course we can quarrel but quarrelling is part of being social um the discussion that he gets into in the descent of man it starts by asking um really for the origins of morality how come uh we as all humans are subject to this thought that what we've done isn't what we ought to have done he says the mysterious word ought um bothers people um remorse is a very widespread human thing um even the mafia you see have their standards uh standards are a a kind of universal thing and it is a very odd one um looked at from as it were an ethological point of view is a bit of natural history it's a pecul- peculiarity of the species and what he says about it really is a bit different from what a lot of other people talking about morals have said um because they tend to say well we have all these animal instincts which are pretty disorganized and often rather bad we also have our reason or our conscience which is a quite separate affair that comes in and straightens it up Darwin doesn't look at it like that he says we have a lot of natural I mean he calls social instincts uh uh emotional tendencies and so forth some of which are helpful to other people and some are not um but they often conflict one with another this of course also happens to other social animals uh one chimpanzee may get very cross with another with whom they're otherwise friendly and may um beat them up when that has happened they do in the end usually become reconciled that the way in which they become reconciled is that the one who's been beaten up comes and apologizes comes and says I'm so sorry and then the one who beat them up uh says okay let's get together again and everybody gets together and nobody the other chimpanzees you see are not saying you shouldn't have done that it really is a distinctive feature etnologically speaking of our species uh that this kind of thing goes on and what Darwin suggests you see is that there is not this separate character called reason or conscience uh which we've somehow developed and nobody else has but that in becoming more intelligent we've become more aware of our lives as a whole and in fact more uh you know a bigger memory and a bigger anticipation of our past and future selves so we are looking at the whole thing in a way that other creatures don't because of this intelligence and therefore we're aware of the conflicts which the other creatures had not noticed and we are therefore put in the position of having to do something about it uh thus we invent our various kinds of morality this is the briefest possible sketch of what Darwin says um and you see I devoted quite a lot of the book to saying what is wrong with um extreme neo-darwinism of present day and I have chiefly talked about the selfish gene not because i've got a special grudge against Dawk- Dawkins but because he's so eloquent and has been so popular is so popular um that he has got this across uh to an immense public and I keep noticing how people who are not supposed to be interested in science at all when they're talking about how some um some uh self-interested and uh disastrous uh act say well of course that's that's human nature it's evolution isn't it you see um there's a sort of fatalism um generated by this line of talk Dawkins didn't invent it any more than Maggie Thatcher invented it I mean the suggestion i'm making about it is this that during the second world war and for quite a time after it um there was quite a strong sociable conscientious feeling about society as a whole uh people were not at all ashamed to shout about the importance of loyalty and of the common good and so forth um that uh persisted as I say for a little time after the war thus we got the national health service and similar things but people were getting a bit bored with it towards the end of the 60s they thought they'd been rationed for long enough uh they didn't want to go in on on eating the national loaf you know that very healthy national loaf I happen to remember got rid of as I noticed at the time uh because people weren't supporting it and so forth um there was a general a general movement of consciousness towards thinking that we should each of us should be considered a little more I still think it's surprising that the word selfish caught on with the selfish gene to the extent that it did but I think the Dawkins in using that word fully understood what the times were demanding he the fashion was inside him he didn't mean to make a great social statement he was trying to talk about evolution this was his first book it was the lectures he'd been given to be giving to his students and it had plainly gone down a bomb and it was it it it seemed to him to be a straightforward uh description of what happens in evolution but in fact it was madly not um I mean the the the idea that the genius selfish uh isn't at all persuasive because genes work along with other genes afterwards after that book Dawkins noticed that and on the 25th anniversary of the selfish gene when there was great celebration going on he said oh it's quite a good book I think it would have been better if I'd called it the cooperative gene because because by then the fact that this is uh simply not science had got through well so if it wasn't science um why was he saying it because I'm thinking this is a myth which was catching on with a lot of people but he put it so very forcibly uh this if anyone feels that I am being uh un- unfair in picking on him this is why I do sometimes use uh other people to quote but he's such a he's such an impressive writer you kind of come back to it um how am I doing for time right yes so um yes I mean I'm thinking you see that this this general reversion to a an individualist a strong individualist point of view um again wasn't new there is a strong tradition of this in our culture dating I suppose from Thomas Hobbes now Hobbes did a smashing job in the 17th century uh reacting against the wars of religion which were going on at that time um saying there's no reason why you should go and uh die or suffer for other people in this kind of war the what is most concerned to you always is your own survival and if you can't um survive and do what people are telling you you have to do something else there was I'm sure similarly um a reaction was beginning and Hobbes kind of spotted it and phrased it terribly forcibly and well um and on the whole the point that he made that um against the feudal situation in which you naturally do uh what your lord tells you and you move as a kind of as part of a a great chunk of people who all move together the idea that each person should think well am I going to survive if I do this uh that's my primary interest um that was I think a new a new thought in the 17th century and of course it's been a tremendously fertile one I mean all this about individual rights that we've gone in for since then um did kind of flow from it again I'm not saying Hobbes invented it he just put it very well and very strongly um and that tradition went on um after a time people uh rather abandoned Hobbs's idea that the best way to survive was to support an absolute monarch because absolute monarchs didn't always help people to survive uh and the business of the social contract which he kind of launched uh was developed in the thought that you you you only have to sacrifice yourself if you've consented to it um well that's all splendid stuff um that tradition of course uh has gone on but something a little different happened in the area of uh self-respect and so forth uh after a time when uh the civil wars of the 17th century were over and life got a bit easier and more established um people began to take it for granted that they would survive they weren't so worried about that because they weren't their lives weren't being threatened all the time they got more interested in having a fulfilling life a life that they had chosen here and now and you see a a quite new element when got into the egoistic tradition uh with Nietzsche uh that is Nietzsche is extremely keen on our own um choosing on our own exactly how we wish to live it's a matter of being authentic um of choosing your course rather than having somebody else choose it for you uh the business of independence uh is worked out in much more thoroughness now um the effect is that as it were a haunting egoist may make very different demands on society from a Nietzschean egoist but a Nietzschean egoist is perhaps in a way uh not so likely to make demands in society as to go off and live on a mountain or um in some other solitary place which of course what was what Nietche did himself so that I mean what I think is quite interesting the the egoist tradition has been developed in many very sophisticated ways since Hobbs and similar people started it it's not in the primitive state that it was in in the 17th century what distressed and bored and bothered me about the selfish gene was it seemed to ignore all that uh it didn't take account of the various things that it might mean do to you for um someone to be acting in their own interest um it took it for granted that uh it's all a matter of of of not even of surviving but of having a suitable number of descendants um it defines defines selfishness in this terribly narrow and um really unfertile um sort of way and it's not of course only Dawkins that did it as I say there's a whole mythology um of um um um talk about evolution in terms of the competitive um investments which everybody is making it's all pretty commercial and grudges and suckers and uh the like the the the the the metaphors are extremely lively now in this morning's discussion on start the week somebody said oh but aren't you being unfair to Dawkins this is only a metaphor metaphors are not only um anyone who chooses one and runs it strongly in their work is saying something um even if they don't say it explicitly it the choice of a metaphor is a most responsible choice um and you see i'm saying that the choice of this term the selfish gene is really extraordinary seeing that genes are not solitary things um and there's a notoriously uh uh uh uh a rather strange transition from the genes being selfish to the people being selfish but it is also said that the people are selfish um the other way in which I'm constantly told I'm unfair to Dawkins is people say oh he's not a fatalist he's not really saying that this is inevitable because he says we have free will now this is a reference to his well-known policy of open manly self-contradiction he's not the only one who does this B F Skinner was very hot on it too if you're saying something which is plainly contrary to what everybody believes and and I mean they live by you just suddenly put in of course not that that's not true but that's not what I'm saying and you don't argue you just go straight back to what you were saying before um which in the case of the selfish gene is that we're uh blundering robots or lumbering robots that's right all you see all organisms are supposed to be lumbering robots being run by their genes um and if having written that you think oh well actually this isn't true because people have free will you've got to alter what you wrote and explain why he never does so I mean this is an obj- objection which I reckon somebody will be about to make so I'm just saying what I think about it in advance um I'm having certain amount of difficulty remembering all that I put in the book in 20 minutes and it might be a bad idea I think to pause at that point thank you yeah all my work is about human nature ah this is a question about the relation between the different disciplines between the different ways of thinking all together isn't it uh yeah uh now my view about that is that these different ways of thinking are are very important after the way to be separate um they are the ways that we use when we approach a subject in a particular way for a particular kind of reason um thus if you look at say newton's thought from the point of view of thought and you're not thinking of other the- uh theories you're talking about the thought the theory uh if you're interested in his life you come in from a different angle um these things are not uh rivals that they need to to bring them together um is always a bit of a special job in which both I think both disciplines have to take part don't they um yes I mean this is the sort of trouble that comes up um with physicalism that is people who say that everything is really physics and the uh the the physical truth about everything is that is is the real one everything else is rather superficial and provisional than halfway now that's nonsense um because if you inquire uh for instance about some about sport um um we want to know what sport is so to speak if you only knew about sport that it is the movement of certain physical particles uh within a certain space you would not know anything about sport um and see I mean the suggestion that if we only had physics that would be we would have all the reality uh the rest doesn't matter is merely silly um but the the the if you develop both of these accounts you will get uh some idea of the physical effect on the bodies which is indeed a bit of biology um and you will also be looking at the psychological and social meaning of this now it's terribly important that you get both isn't it um and this is always setting us problems in bringing them together um but um I don't uh the thing I particularly don't like is the approach to human nature which says there must be one central explanation of it you see um the kind of um well I don't want to be crude about Freud but the Freudian approach it's pretty well sex essentially um or the the Marxist uh approach that it's it it's all the desire for wealth um these are really not helpful um and there have been too many uh sort of confident attempts to explain human nature explain it in the sense of finding one one one pattern which is what is really essential to it I don't uh have much belief in them well it's something which is very important about human beings um which we kind of need to cultivate um when people say it's special about human beings that seems to suggest that no other animal has it and I don't feel that confident about what life is like for elephants you know pick on elephants they live as long as we do they mourn their dead friends uh they communicate in ways which we do not understand I simply don't feel confident in saying that an old elephant as he walked away of having dealt with the bones of his dead friend mightn't say it's funny we do this you know um become aware of I don't think it matters you see um and I don't think um people have been so frightfully uh obsessed and bothered about this thought that they have to prove that we're different from all the other animals um in all the ways that are honourable about us now is he actually what Dawking or Darwin is saying what Darwin is saying in the descent of man is uh really of great interest here because he says you know the social instincts that we have we include you see love and affection and friendship and all these very honourable things we do share with the other creatures in social creatures in many ways um but we give ourselves this extra difficulty and these extra opportunities by being more aware of them uh so the awareness indeed is very important but uh that they're to say that it's unique to people I really don't feel confident yeah well um the neo-darwinian view the Dawkins type view is an extremely confident statement that there is no meaning um and that everything is caused by accident I don't think the word accident makes much sense here an accident is something which within an ordinary ordered causal sequence um is an interruption comes in from somewhere else an accident is an interruption in a series to say that everything is accident makes no sense as far as I know um and what they mean of course uh they're shooting at religion all the time which I find boring um and they what they mean is that there isn't a person who's done it we use the word accident in human life when we mean that nobody did it well okay that's not the question um the question is about order about whether there appears to be an order here now Darwin who indeed had uh dropped the Christianity that he was brought up with raised the question in his autobiography of um belief in god and said um  one argument for it of an intellectual kind seems to me very strong that is I cannot think and it is he says not only difficult but impossible to conceive the immense order that we see without thinking of it as in some way connected with something like a human mind that's not saying there's a chap out there that did it it's saying it is a kind of order which is also shown in the human mind uh there is something akin in the order of our mind to the order of the universe that seems to me to be rather good sense
