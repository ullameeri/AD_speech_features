no you know but I always loved Billie Holiday it as a child uh my mother was is a real jazz lover and everything and um so I had been through those same experiences and I just I said hey I got to do this and I'm not going to try to do it like Billie Holiday I just want to put that same feeling in the in the air you know what I mean yeah matter of fact it was here in New York City and I think it was for NBC but it was NBC radio at that time and they had a show that they call the show um uh jazz plus so equals blues and I didn't know which one I was I said I wonder because I was about 17 18 years old and um Count Basie was there myself and then Billie Holiday was coming and I remember waiting for her to come because I want to see Lady Day and I sat there and we waited and she was late and finally uh the door swung open and there she was Lady Day it was just like I mean Billie Holiday and uh she came to the door and there were two men with her one on each sides yeah they were helping her with the elbows and um she was walking in very slowly and I was looking at her from her head to to the top of her to the from my toes to her head and I looked in and I saw noticed her feet she had only spaghetti strap shoes and her feet were very swollen and uh she was so then I realized they were really helping her to walk and then when she sat down she sat down about two seats away from me and I didn't want to really stare at her but I kind of was looking you know like oh my at her and I looked at her hands and her hands were like boxing gloves that's the closest I could think about it and then she looked at me we finally locked eyes and she said to me she says are you looking at me she had that growl in her voice and I said yes she said don't let this ever happen to you and that's what was so strange it was like because I wasn't into drugs or I wasn't in just was a young girl who start singing and loved her as part of the the women that I loved in show business and but I remembered when I later on became addicted all of that flash back on me is like how did she why did she tell me that why did she look into my eyes and say don't let this I mean what made her think that that's it and I and you know Sue I have been a fool and I'm still a fool I mean I went into the Nashville Tennessee and he was there and um a friend of mine was with me and she called the hotel where he was and I said well and he says well sure come on down and he's this real animated thing you know it's just like the the connection of all that I'm listening on the phone when she calls I said okay let's go on down we get a limousine and we go down to the hotel and he's sitting across the lobby and as we walk in but he had this little kind of little floozy with him kind of like a little country country and western girl now I guess he must be what 85 years old and he was sitting there and as I came across as I came up the stairs I looked over to it toward the lobby and there he was sitting there and I was so scared I made my seat talking about butterflies I was so scared as I walked toward him he looked at me but then he kind of looked away it was like he didn't want to stare me down as I totally as I was looking at him coming toward him and this little floozy was sitting here and she was like yeah that's her she's coming in here what is this all about and I I met I ass- assumed that he hadn't talked to her about anything because I had talked to him many many years ago on a phone in Talton Illinois and I said I don't want anything all I want to know is did you know this black lady girl yeah but quite naturally this girl was 14 years old so he's not going to admit he says I don't know
