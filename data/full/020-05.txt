well there's no question that the Congress has gone too far and eroding the power of the President to conduct foreign policy in the broadest sense uh I think the most striking example was the passage of the War Powers Act in 1973 over my veto uh that's a complicated act but summarizing it it said very simply that uh a president whenever he sends American armed forces into a foreign country or foreign territorial waters uh must inform the Congress within 48 hours and that mean he must withdraw those forces within 60 days unless the Congress uh declares war or unless the Congress authorizes keeping the forces there now as far as that provision is concerned it's interesting to note that uh President Ford who succeeded me uh President Carter President Reagan President Bush have all rejected its app- application as far as their actions are concerned uh as far as my own views are concerned I believe as I indicated in my veto message that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional uh but what is even more important uh I believe that it is very bad public policy let me give you an example uh you'll remember because you covered at the time of the situation with the Yom Kippur War in 1973 uh this was before this act was passed uh at that time I received a very urgent call from Golda Meir uh the war was going against them the Russians had a huge air lift to the Egyptians and she said we have to have more arms please help us or we will not uh survive we would be defeated I ordered the biggest airlift and history is even bigger than the Berlin Airlift uh it was very successful it righted the balance Israel survived and Golda Meir wrote afterwards in her books and and her conversation with me and her public statements that that was what saved the day what is even more important it laid the groundwork for peace now had the War Powers Act been in effect at that time it would made it enormously difficult almost impossible for us to go through that very intricate kind of operation we have to remember this uh that when a president sends forces into an area uh the purpose sometimes is not to wage war its to wage peace that's why we were sending these forces and the Congress therefore uh should keep his hands out of that and the president should be allowed that kind of power uh the president just doesn't get up one day and say look I'm going to bomb these people uh you have to have the very best people you can around you to advise you I was fortunate in having Henry Kissinger uh and an excellent staff in the White House uh fortunate also on having excellent people in the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Department and in the State Department with whom I could consult and also consult knowledgeable people in the Congress as well particularly in the Senate but once he has consulted all these people and when he has to make the decision, then he must go into a quiet place and make that decision and it must be his I had to make several decisions that were terribly difficult were very controversial uh but I made them only after a great consultation well there were there were several occasions one of the most controversial was what was called the secret bombing of Cambodia and 1969 let's understand what that really was first it wasn't secret uh I vividly recall a meeting I had with Dick Russell and John Stennis who were the two most powerful Democrats in the House I went over the whole situation with them I pointed out that our military commanders in the field uh we're making the point uh that we were losing many American lives because uh the enemy uh was attacking from Cambodia which was supposed to be neutral and then going back across the line uh and we couldn't follow up and so they had strongly urge that we bomb those sanctuaries so I ordered the bombing uh after of course consulting also with the cabinet with the National Security Council uh and with selected members of Congress uh it proved to be very effective because as a result of that we didn't have a Tet Offensive that year the second uh area that uh was very controversial as you know was the so-called incursion or invasion or whatever of Cambodia in 1970 why was that done it was done again because we had these sanctuaries where enemy troops who were making hit-and-run attacks on Americans and on our Vietnamese allies killing them by the thousands and we did not have uh the authority they did not have the authority uh to go back and to try to eradicate those areas under the circumstances uh I ordered again after consultation with the all of the top officials in the government and with the Congress and so forth I ordered the attack it proved to be very effective we knocked out six of the sanctuaries eh and there were no Tet Offensive that year as well no not at all no it was in during wartime the Commander-in-Chief has authority to make decisions of that sort that's why he's Commander-in-Chief I ordered the bombing and mining of Haiphong three weeks before the Soviet summit many people objected to that because they said the Soviets would cancel the summit but uh the North Vietnamese with Soviet tanks had invaded the south and I thought if if I couldn't go to Moscow three weeks later when Soviet tanks were rumbling through Saigon it worked The summit was not cancelled, and uh we earned a little respect by it as well as the agreements we wanted perhaps one of the most difficult decisions was the the bombing in December of 1972 uh we had to resume the bombing by B-52's the reason was that the North Vietnamese had backed away from the peace agreements that we thought were going to end the war uh and that they had made before the elections of 1972 I ordered the bombing it was enormously effective and as a result of that the North Vietnamese came back to the peace table we negotiated the settlement uh which ended the war and uh ended the American involvement in the war on January the 27th of 1973 uh now all of those decisions were controversial but all of them I would take again because my goal at that time was to use force in a way that would end the war he must not be compelled to inform the Congress on occasions when it's necessary for example to engage in secret diplomacy let me be very specific on that uh had uh we had a requirement for informing the Congress without secret diplomacy we would never have the opening to China you were there when we went to be Peking we would never have the arms control agreement with the Soviet Union and we would never had the peace agreement with Vietnam there are times when it's necessary for a president to have so-called secret negotiations and in the case of forces to commit forces without going through uh all of the legalistic requirements that Congress would like uh uh case can be made for that uh but the reason that that is uh written about a great deal is that the world has changed a great deal since the Constitution was written uh 200 years ago uh let's take for example the provision uh for in the Constitution which provides first that the the Congress shall have the power to declare war uh the president shall be the Commander-in-Chief  now that was very appropriate in those times because 200 years ago it was the custom as you know for nations before they ever engaged in war to declare war that is not the case today well I believe that uh one of the one of the negative fallout of of of the of the so-called Watergate investigations was frankly and I put it in a very direct language the castration of the CIA uh we need the CIA not only to gather intelligence but we need the CIA also to conduct a covert operations when we do not want uh to have public declarations of war or what have you uh actions on the part of the United States uh I would say further with regard to uh the CIA uh that as as a result of the restrictions that have been placed upon it uh the we do not have the weapons that we need to have to deal with the kind of a world we live in uh let's face it uh those who confront us in various parts of the world have their own CIA's uh and for us to go in uh and effect a blind up against others who know everything is not in our interest but I think that the CIA uh instead of being criticized it ought to be supported but of course restrained insofar as activities like uh the the very stupid you know moves which they were even contemplating about assassinating Castro the Constitution is a remarkable document in the sense that it applies so well to conditions that could not have even been uh considered possible at the time it was written but in this case the declaration of war provision is an anachronism that doesn't mean that the president should willy-nilly uh go into war without congressional support I was once a member of the House I was a member of the Senate and when you're over there uh you look upon the executive with suspicion you don't want too much power there there shouldn't be too much power either place but in the conduct of foreign policy in today's world it is very important that the president be allowed a great deal of discretion particularly when it's going to be necessary times to conduct even secret negotiations to preserve peace and to avoid war well I have ideas as to what should be done but I don't know how I could bring it off I I would say this first let's look at divided government what's going to happen for the balance of this century uh for the balance of this century I I would predict at the present time you're going to continue to have divided government I think the Republicans will control the White House and the executive uh the Democrats will almost certainly control the House they were probably control the Senate and so it's a fact uh not a theory that we are confronted with here we're going to have divided government now divided government is bad in some ways but not bad in other ways uh I'm not one to defend it particularly if I were president I'd like to have a Congress that was of my own party uh but when you do have divided government it forces a president to speak to the country and to govern in a way in which he crosses party lines he doesn't make his appeals on the basis of partisanship but he tries to reach out and and get support from Democrats as well as Republicans or if he's a Democratic president from Republicans as well as Democrats And let me say some of the great achievements have been made when we had divided government uh People forget that the Marshall Plan the Greek Turkish Aid Program uh the great containment policies which uh kept the peace in Europe that was all passed by a Republican 80th Congress supporting Harry Truman who was a Democratic president so on that score uh divided government can serve useful purpose let me say too that to have a a government in which a president has two big majorities in the House and Senate is not healthy I think it was not a good thing when Johnson had overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate and some of the worst features of his Great Society programs were passed at that time they would not have been passed had you had more opposition uh I think the one area where divided government is particularly difficult is is in the area of uh the Senate The president has to have the Senate to confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court to the regulatory agencies uh to the cabinet etc He also has to have the Senate uh to approve treaties uh And so it makes it very difficult to deal with the Senate that is of the opposition parties I would the founders expected uh and it proved that this did not work out in practice that people would not serve in Congress over extended periods of time that there would be turnover and I think it would be healthy in today's world in which events change so much to bring in new generations of leaders uh and so in this instance with the presidency limited to eight years I think the House and the Senate should be the House certainly should be limited to twelve years uh the Senate maybe to 18 years at the very most I think it would be a healthy development but I don't see the Congress ever passing it because they uh uh have a vested interest in the status quo there's no question but that there were shall we say partisan overtones and the Watergate investigations uh The committee was loaded uh the committees in Congress it was a Democratic House of course uh a Democratic Senate as well I would say however that uh uh there were Republicans as well as Democrats uh who participated in the investigations and reached the conclusion so that they did So that I'm not going to to say that Watergate would not have happened uh had it not been partisan but there's no question that some of the excesses of the investigations in Watergate uh against people like Maurice Stans and others uh would not have happened had it not been partisan I'd like to be just as objective as possible in talking about the role of the media it is very important for a president for a cabinet officer congressman or senator uh to be held accountable to be kept on his toes and and the media the day does that the media is in an adversarial position with regard to uh public officials and that is healthy in its way uh on the other hand we have to realize that that a president uh and we're referring on referring only to the president at the moment uh must not simply do the bidding of the media because he was elected and they were not uh speaking of the media to we have to realize that and I think this is frankly not a helpful development uh and that is that television plays too much of a role today I I was shocked to see a poll of a couple years ago to the effect that seventy-five percent of the people polled said they made up their minds with regard to the candidates they were going to support from what they heard on television I liked the days in the fifties when the writing process was more dominant because I could sit down with a good intelligent writer political writer and talk to him on or off the record and I we could have a good dialogue I would learn from it and he would heard from it as well but in television what matters is some script writer will give you a
clever line to say and you've got to get it across in 10 to 15 or 20 seconds and that line is all that people are going to remember uh rather than uh than your maybe very intelligent discussion for two or three minutes of a major issue I mean for example we discuss something like the War Powers Act you can't answer that with a quip if you do you're totally irresponsible and yet television forces candidates uh to be sometimes certainly uh a simplistic and sometimes even silly uh because only by being silly sometimes can you really make the evening news then in television age how you look is more important than how you think uh more important than what you say now having said that however it means that when we select our candidates we've got to remember that they must learn to use uh television if they are unable to communicate on television a president for example isn't going to be able to get support for his programs and a candidate isn't going to be elected no I I I'm not bitter about it that's a something that we learned uh the importance of television and John Kennedy was very good on television uh he made a very good appearance on television But I must say that I have had my moments and television too I save my political career by going on television in the famous fun speech back in 1952 the Checker's speech so called in 1969 I made a speech to the nation the so called silent majority speech which kept support for the Vietnam War until we were able to end it on a peaceful basis uh so you can learn to to use television well when I was president I didn't have as many press conferences I should have had because I can handle a press conference fairly well because I I spend a lot of time preparing for press conferences I don't do anything off the top of my head when I can avoid it uh but during a war it's very difficult to have a press conference you simply can't be candid and of course during the so-called Watergate period it was very difficult to have a press conference uh but had I survived I would have had far more press conferences I would have had them on television whenever possible because I'd rather have my views go directly to the people were they can hear me saying it rather than having it filtered through uh anchormen or frankly writing press who give their views as to what I said  I like it very much uh I think there's a tendency in the press conference today to to move from one issue to another they do allow a follow-up question but one isn't enough sometimes sometimes you have to have two or three I think a single issue a press conference would be more informative you see the purpose of the press conference should be and the purpose of a television appearance should be 1) to inform the public 2) to educate uh and the 3rd of course to win uh support for policies well let me let me be quite candid on that uh uh members of the press whether the writing press or the television press don't win prizes uh by programs or by articles or buy books which are supportive or positive about the people they're writing about I mean you win prizes by being against rather than be for it's not good it's not good I think a lot of the responsibility lies with the editors rather than with the reporters. If the editors would be a little bit more responsible uh maybe we would get more honest and more objective reporting I don't believe incidentally that you should have a cozy relationship between a president or a congressman and and a reporter uh it should be arm's length it should be adversarial because otherwise you're just going to have people that are going to pander to you but on the other hand it shouldn't be so adversarial uh that who that the president of the Congress and so forth is always on guard and figures well they're out to get me and so I'm going to therefore uh uh not tell them what I really think there there probably should be but I wouldn't be for it I think once you start down that road it's a very dangerous road uh as irresponsible as the press is at times and I believe it is uh and the media is at times uh uh it's far better not to have that kind of control I am opposed to a constitutional amendment which would require a balanced budget I think it would be a mistake and incidentally the very fact that we uh have had armed uh action in the Persian Gulf the fact that we're in a recession demonstrates why that is a bad idea when war comes or when a recession comes it's going to be necessary sometimes to have unbalanced budgets we have to understand that so I'm opposed to that that is too rigid On the other hand the line-item veto is a good idea let me tell you I'm sure like other I've I have at times had to hold my nose to sign a piece of legislation uh which was needed for the to carry out my own program which was I thought the best interests the country, but which had attached to it pork barrel items that various congressmen or senators had attached and I had to sign it because otherwise I couldn't get what was needed now let me say that a line item veto would mean that the president could strike out some of these irresponsible ludicrous provisions where the economy is concerned uh it's been my experience that the less the federal government fiddles with or interferes with the economy the better that it operates now let's go back to what I did and uh I recall so well, and you will recall it to in 1971 August of 1971 uh I uh imposed wage and price controls Now I didn't do that because I wanted them I did it because we had inflation then that incidentally it was five percent and everybody thought that was very very high--but we had inflation and we were coming out of a recession but the Congress was going to pass a wage and price control uh uh bill and I had to uh frankly preempt it and pass one that was and uh ask them for one that I thought was uh at least less detrimental now that decision in August of 1971 was very popular politically It however was wrong from the standpoint of the economy it turns out to be Wage and price controls I felt were wrong before I had to uh because of congressional pressure to uh to compose them and I think it's wrong in the future I don't think a president ought to have that much control over the economy As far as the president's concern he does have this control as you know He has control over the economy because he submits a budget he can submit requests for taxes which a tax the Congress has to approve he appoints the regulatory bodies and one other one other uh appointment area which is very important as the Federal Reserve now the Federal Reserve can probably have more effect on an economy than any other institution in government there are those who think that the Federal Reserve should be moved under the Treasury Department I disagree with that the Federal Reserve should be independent as it is today independent because uh uh if you if you have it under the Treasury Department it means you get too much control to the executive over the economy and then when mistakes are made, they're very very big ones I want to have any controls over the economy spread out as much as possible uh so that when mistakes are made uh they won't have as bad an impact
