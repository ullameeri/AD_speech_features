it's the only place I've ever lived that I know the date that I moved here and the year and it's really home this is um our the house was intact like it was when I walked through the gates the first time I said this is really amazing yeah I miss this place when I'm working this would be three kids I figure Trio is good for nothing alright I can be the I don't want to be the leader I just want to be in the band of the three kids or musician you know that way they could they could be like the Beatles or somebody right now say who's the old guitar player in the band that's what I’d love he grew up with that with that feel you know it was amazing he was he could keep time long before he could walk it's such a joy to be around them you know to to play with it to go swimming with them being around the kids it’s it makes it a difference in your life I was daddies last son and um it seemed like he kind of took me under his wing I was I've always been his baby boy you know and he always took care of me and he was dad was a a great man and I realized there will be a load of compromising on the road to my horizon but I want to be where the light is shining on me and um not every time I sing it on stage now look at it as the light of God rather than any stage light I guess it was born for the God had this plan for me I have no idea I know I'm not smart enough to get here by myself somebody you know was up there watching over me and said okay now you do this and now you do this and it was just like the salmon that swim up the river eight hundred miles to find where they were born you know I think I'm still swimming upstream I learned to sing I think in the churches so mom always took us to church because we were all breastfed if you wanted your food you went to church with mama the first song I ever remember singing all the way through was We’re Gonna Go Back To The Lord Boo taught me to play guitar and he made me use me he'd make me use my little finger I didn't use my little Fang he'd get a power wire pliers and squeeze it till it hurt I mean it hurt so therefor us if you see me play today you'll see me using my little finger a lot it stuck with me I left when I was 14 and I'd made the last crop for daddy in there that summer and um it didn't take me long to figure out that the guitar was a lot better way to make a living than than looking at the north end of a southbound mule if it hadn’t been for her I know I don’t know what I'd have been doing today but eh eh eh mama was that was one of the important turn turning points in my life I figured if you know if ever got in trouble I could hock my guitar and mama could pick cotton and get it out for me eh eh eh I remember being hungry and cold when I was a kid I don't know if that motivated me or not I think I've been very lucky um I think everything just happened in my in my life up to this point was for a reason so I could maybe gain a little wisdom a little understanding about life and what it's about well that was that was decided for me you know we were always taught to live up to our responsibilities so I got married the kid came about two months later so it was a I work fast so it was one of those it was one of those situations it was just something that a responsibility that I I did it it was it was I brought it all on so live up to it and I did it to the best way I could anyway there was um my the son he didn't he didn't live over two weeks he was pre- um premature but um I got a lovely daughter out of it and so it's I guess it works out for the best you can't go out and party all night and half of the day and get up on stage and do a song well it I wasn’t actually partying I was just stayin up figuring out or get drunk you know and I realize I was bastardized on a god-given talent I don't know what got me that way in the first place it was lies and deception from the people that around me that I thought were being honest with me and it really got to me I said how can this be I wasn't happy on stage but um I was very very insecure um I just knew there had to you know if something had to click there was something better than the way everything was going you know so I just I had to get out of what I had dug myself into up to that point I met somebody that I was compatible with that um wasn't you know BSing and wasn't trying to it's it use me for anything other than companionship and love and it’s it's amazing for the main thing she treats me like a man and she treats me like the position that I'm in as a man as a husband as a father Gentle On My Mind is a good one True Grit is a great song I think it is it's a
