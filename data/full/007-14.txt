it’s been wonderful hasn’t it well it’s so funny you get this letter uh from uh Downing Street say that your name’s been put forward to the queen and kind of if you don’t want it you got to let them know but you you know I wasn’t expecting it really I mean I you don’t expect that but once they write to you and say yes we’re going you know we’re thinking of giving it to you you go oh you can’t wait and you got immediately uh made me think of my mum you know how swelled and how proud she’d be oh she would’ve loved it because she always wanted me to be posh my mum yes uh her daughter Babs being posh you know and she sent me to elocution lessons believe it or not and the first job I got was in um Belsize Saint Trinion you know yelling out the the window bye bye madam see you next doors and she was appalled she was a bit of a cockney snob my mum a good a good lady but she wanted to better herself that was it so she would’ve been and the fact is you know I got f- the name Windsor cause I changed my name when I was about 16 I was in a show called Love From Judy and uh they said Deeks which was my name Barbara Deeks wasn’t a good stage name you see yeah that’s right I I didn’t I actually said that I said it was very nice talking to her I said you know cause I’m a Windsor as well you see but I took the name from my auntie Dollie and it was also the the uh the cor- the coronation uh year as well so that that was um yes yes it was well I’ve know the great miss Patsy forever and I also I mean since I was about 19 20 oh oh that’s just outside but you see you know the proper frog you know and I uh in fact I was so thrilled that she’d be made a dame and it was an automatic thing to do you just go oh madam you know like that of course she fell about laughing she’s street it it was good and it just captured the imagination of the press didn’t it you see yeah it was lovely oh yeah he was absolutely thrilled to bits you know he was running around trying to get him uh uh a shirt that would kind of match my outfit you know I said you can’t have blue and he’s can I have a little bit of peachy pink in it we were doing all that on the set and then he thought with all the sales I f- I didn’t realise it was the sales so all of it went it was lovely my dear agent Barry Barnet you know Barry he he came with me and it was a whole wonderful day and it was so thrilled for you the public they’re they’re saying Bar oh terrific great uh Bar it was the most wonderful wonderful experience yeah oh goodness me and I saw you yes me in all my wisdom yelling at Glo Glo here we are you was had this posh frock on didn’t you this was this great parade for the the wonderful queen mother that we were part of that was a magnificent day cause I went from meeting one queen to another queen and then in the evening a couple of other queens I don’t know I really don’t know and we made to it uh so many days and then I kept getting pulled into EastEnders and then suddenly out of nowhere we went for let’s say two weeks made phone calls booked the uh orchestra managed to book marrilable you know the the the registry office and it all fell into place because we we just yeah we just uh well I was coming to your your birthday actually nobody knew about it but uh I phoned you up didn’t I because I didn’t want to it was glorious big birthday were not gonna say what and and she’d invited it was the day after we got married and we’d I’d you know both Scott and I said we can’t take that away from Gloria it’s her day so so I phoned you up and said no we wouldn’t be going but we’re thinking about you next thing knock on the door and it was lovely Steve your old man saying Glo said you gotta go no no I I didn’t well you get uh the rumours or the unauthorised biographies you know and uh you just think oh I don’t really want someone taking my life and you know talking about it I know about my life so that’s how I started it and but what I wasn’t prepared for uh k- kind of said okay yeah that’s been nine months a year but we had a hick-up in EastEnders about uh last February when Mike was taken ill who plays Frank Butcher so kind of six weeks I lost because I thought they’re gonna write me out because they wrote him out I thought they’re gonna write me out but they they didn’t they said we’ve kicked in this storyline you’re the only one who can take that storyline over so I did and I was acting a bit like a bit of with all the cars and that I didn’t know what I was talking about so that and and then suddenly EastEnders said you’re going on location for two weeks in Spain we’ve just come back from Spain in Alicante doing a a very important episode which was uh Roberta Taylor who’s leaving who plays Irene so it is it was tingled with a sadness actually cause she’s going cause we’re all great friends oh oh we did well we we of course we did you can’t help it oh yeah but you don’t really wanna be in Alicante and EastEnders not really I mean the sun’s blazing down and everybody’s going off and having fiestas uh siestas isn’t it yeah yeah I’m fiestas that as well but you know you can’t help but have a laugh with uh on EastEnders they are very believe it or not we do they’re great great great people and of course Marie is wonderful I’m devastated cause he’s he’s leaving oh yeah that’d be lovely yeah I am I mean I’m sure people will think oh God we we know a lot about her because I’m always making the press you know but there’s a lot more uh I yes there is an awful lot more I mean I’ve called it All of Me like a twat I am I mean I fancy calling it All of Me because I really got to dig deep and I have I have this time yeah yes it is it is I do find lots of times I’m crying as I’m writing you know but

movie of it so I was very lucky to go to Broadway that’s a wonderful experience they say theatre is good here but my god it’s good old Broadway ah well as Davis Sour says theatre’s wonderful it’s music isn’t it and Paul Newman oh yeah of course oh yeah yes they are of course they are in the book but I’m not gonna say any more well I found myself doing what people do and I’m so glad they do it to me say can I have your autograph please can you sign it to May can you attach my mum Rose I did all that I did all that and I it’s wonderful that’s why well you know I I love the public and I know
