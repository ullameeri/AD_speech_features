well I didn't I never believed it in the first place it would have been a tragedy it would have been just ridiculous if that charge had been brought but uh he he said it he's right in what he just said there aren't any winners in this and it doesn't just go away and what it must have put him through no no I didn't I left a message last night but I think everybody's left a message I think it's answer machine must be going out the window absolutely ridiculous I mean you know how it is when you work I mean particularly in in Grenada doing Corey you're sort of like sardines in a tin with scripts you know there's not very much room for anybody after all those years I think he was the epitome of of the English gentleman and I I think Annie said that as well an he got right but he was he was somebody he was the elder statesman William not Ken Roach because he probably yes but but darling we we do know that you gentlemen do exaggerate these things it could have been Ballie Who it could have been but it it was I and I don't think at any point in Bill's life he he's not the sort of person who would have forced himself on anyone and I don't think he ever needed to really I don't think he had people running after him from all directions well I mean are are the CPS I I mean they've got like health and safety haven't they it is my view that they have gone like my view my humble view that they've gone like health and safety because I mean if health and safety have been around at the beginning of the war I mean they probably would have stopped that little boats going to Dunkirk cause there they weren't safe and I think it's gone the same way this ridiculous um oh well I mean I sort of started look lost night in the case and I mean somebody who couldn't remember it's not helping women if you bring a case that doesn't stand up well the police think not because they wanted to bring yes I actually think they should remain anonymous but but then if it's somebody uh in the public eye how would you ever remain anonymous because the media will be on to it the others would come forward but then I what worries me is when people go back and say oh I just remember that 16 yeah 50 years ago it's 60 years ago I can't quite remember when uh and that person is really famous if anybody can put it to bed just in seven it's Bill Roach because if he if anyone I know who is the most positive loving kind honest man and above all Bill is a very honest man he is a nobleman he should be being knighted not attacked
