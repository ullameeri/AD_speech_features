um we were all friends and we tended to spend a lot of time together thinking about what's wrong with philosophy in Oxford um because we thought something was um but we were um um we were not as it were um hiring premises you know we would feel ourselves uh uh a group but we did tend to do that and I can particularly remember us all being in front row and saying we shall have to do something about this it was in a sort of the way that people do you know not particularly expecting that they'll be able to uh but we were uh that there was something wrong with the way in which philosophy was being conducted in Oxford then well it was decidedly supposed to be being about words and small questions about words small questions about the ambiguity of particular term terms um seemed to obsess our teachers not everybody by the way we were very lucky that we did have some teachers who were not in this line um Nolan MacKinnon was teacher to three of us and he was as far as you can get from this sort of thing but I remember a time that particularly depressed me I'd been to meeting a philosophical meeting with somebody if you have read a paper and then people will discuss it the paper that they read was about a very small very small verbal point raised by some of Austin's writings but the discussion wasn't about that it was about much smaller points which remained to raise much smaller ambiguities um and I sat in the seat on the high up on my way how and thought oh dear does this have to happen yes I mean I take it it's a very common situation for uh some students to be uh feeling a bit rebellious in this sort of way I don't think that every time it happens they find themselves uh form a group later in life but it was about time that something was done you see so I think we were as it were quite lucky uh we disapproved of Austin we knew he was very clever and was raising big questions but he um he always honed in on these small questions now one quite interesting thing about this is when I was a graduate student he was running a very famous class on Saturday mornings and it was a great sort of honour to be asked to be in this because it was supposed to be very highbrow and what they were doing was investigating certain ambiguities you see the meaning of some words you thought you knew what this word meant but actually you didn't now um I was lucky enough to get out of Oxford before I ever got asked to do this Philippa didn't do it for a bit and I think she would have been absolutely better at it than I would have ever been I my I have one reason I wouldn't like this because I know like I'm really stupid I don't see this thing you know um um but um it wasn't only that I I I increasingly from that time on I thought they're wasting their time because there are much bigger questions that's the point there's so much larger world which they were not looking at yes that's been 1950 well I think we influenced each other I mean we picked up in the first place by starting some conversation in the middle of the morning and going often I would with someone else and eating minced pork pie um and we remained there until six o'clock realised just like talking um and that continued um yes I mean we were part of what I think was a rather interesting group of graduate students just after the war people who had been doing all sorts of other things you see these tended to be grownups they were not going straight on from school um so I think that goods good conversation was going on on the fact that the classes we went to and in-between time um and certainly I mean Jeff never stopped talking philosophy not till the day of his death but he preferred to do his pet occupation was to go and sit in the junior common room with the students and talk with them uh this is something that you wouldn't be allowed to do these days you know if you you are supposed to do it nine ten sort of times or something uh anyway you you're certainly not you're just ought to be doing your but those students of course come back from time to time and say well just what a splendid thing it was and I can't because people from time to time who occupy themselves in the same way but they're usually of course not being paid to do that um and I don't know how I obviously that's what happened wasn't it that uh people and and and and ask each other awkward questions and this would go on well I was very willing to write um about anything that anybody would ask me to unless there was something wrong with it um quite soon after losing college I was asked to do talks on the third programme the the third program was uh uh an extra one day others being at home surface and light programme that's right that program was meant to be a little bit more intellectual um but not that I'm terribly dull you know at that time I think he must have come up on strength after the war probably um or towards the end of the war um it was very intelligent I say well done and there was a a  producer there called Anna Callin who very much stoked my stuff and attended to publish everything I could favour anyway we'd work together only she'd suggest things um the only exception about this the only time she turned down something that I suggested was when I had written an article about the interesting fact that nearly all really famous philosophers were bachelors they didn't didn't have to contend with family life now this now seems a perfectly respectable a normal thing to say she thought it was disgusting but of course you must not interfere that domestic life interfere with the um uh serious philosophical topics we are talking about yes um quite lately some women who are studying my work at Durham um picked up this and said gosh this is interesting it's called rings and books we see for obvious reasons um and that these days uh it's just a bit of rather intelligent feminism um because then it's you know if you me if you think about it this fact that a human never had to contend um um all kinds a particular kind family life with whatever they uh without having other people near to him um him opposing him of making difficulties this really makes a difference and Aristotle's one of the very few who did you see and I think that it improved his improved his work some philosophers like uh Berkeley and GE Moore got married after they finished so I mean they weren't it wasn't being a nuisance in the family or um um family wasn't being a nuisance to race um but but I mean if you think that to the monastic tradition you see and and the people like Aquinas I told you it made a difference and and like Plato I but but past about Plato because every other class breed did did get married in general but you never hear that Plato you know well yes I mean if I'm going to write something I see no point in doing it if nobody's going to be able to read it and as I am writing I am constantly thinking well what's somebody heard from that you know um and I I think what what's gonna happen is I then go off for lunch and I something occurs to me so I come back and and put it in um and it doesn't seem to me that anything virtuous about writing dull you know some people can't help it but but uh that you should somehow say the thing in a way that peo- make that gets it across to people seems to me part part of the poet um and I mean I suppose in a way Filippa thought I was wasting my time because I was talking about among about the subjects but I think I was often doing philosophy about them but well it never even it was never a separate separate topic to me well that was really quite interesting I had put an article in the periodical philosophy uh or the concept of beastliness Max Plank who was one of the editors or knew the editors liked this um and said I want this woman to come to Cornell so he invited me to Cornell and he arranged our program of different talks with anthropologists and physicists and mathematicians and majorly critics and god knows who because then I  what I was writing touched on all these things I in this once very hard work um but then the Cornell press said uh there was a book so I gave him a book um by that time I was feeling that it was sort of coming together you see that I had some idea of what ought to be central to this book um and what I was trying to make central to reports that the idea of rationality that if we say what people are rational we're not just saying they get their logic right we're saying that they've got a good um hierarchy of ideas a a pattern which works out as a whole well well I sent out him to the Commodore press they sent it back say now put it in the sociobiology which was the fashion of the day you see their Sadlers was a sort of pre-Dawkings Dawkings um the same sort of um reductive stuff so I thought this enormous book and fitted it in which was again very hard work um but I think that time I mean obviously this simple thing because that was what everybody wanted to talk about at the time by this time I was really pretty deeply involved you see and a great range of subjects I had been aiming very hard to get the relevance of different subjects to each other clear to bring things together which were being considered separately um and everything I've written since probably takes off in some direction from that pattern trying to put together in beast and man and in this way I was doing nothing similar to what the other ladies whom I'm now being linked were doing an Iris Murdock was keen on doing just that bringing things together and making this sort of ethics sort of was talked realistic thinking about the world um and so was Elisabeth Anscor was particularly furious with the uh rather superficial sort of ethics that was going on I I I must kick it again she wrote a an article called Modern Moral Philosophy you know and uh using I was younger and a little bit more polite but she was not polite she was very she was very strongly about presenting them and quite quietly and um Filippa was doing this in a different way so I mean we we were all uh working together on what one can describe another not say we say on the negative side you see both didn't work going on um but if you do that you've gotta be having something in common more positively and I think we did it was reductive it was over abstract it was aiming to simplify the moral life to a formula people and this was true for a lot of philosophy I think that people thought they'd got there well I'm saying doesn't even look pretty much like I'd see a set of equations then then modelling on mathematics which picked up with Descartes I mean this was a quite a widespread thought you said uh we need to find there needs to be uh uh a Newton of psychology well this is treating psychology like physics but it isn't physics you see I commented on this in beast and man I said it doesn't come from psychology doesn't and didn't need a Newton what it needs is a Darwin someone who will study all the details about explain why the bits are put together you see um this um merged to get more and more abstract um I think was very deadly to ethics and I did I think what we were all saying in common is really quite an obvious knowledge thing that you can't do ethics like mathematics it isn't like mathematics it isn't like physics um it's a matter of understanding um what's happening when people like moral uh judgements or moral campaigns uh understanding it in relation to the rest of their lives saying what what it's coming from what it's meant to be achieving um and I mean I think they that one might say the worship of physics has increased since then it's still thought to be the centre of somehow the centre of of science the centre of understanding of life um and what I don't want to be rude about physics I think it's very important I think it's not that you see it's got it's own work to do not a different one very much so very much so that's right yes um I mean I find it hard to convey the way at that time it was habitual with a lot of very different people saying there is no such thing as human nature uh this one thing um behaviourists who wanted to say that uh psychology is entirely about art outside actions and the way to understand outside actions is to see how they are caused by other out outside actions this is the the the motives didn't matter um and it seems it seemed to me at once and I think it seemed to all of us quite absurd because in the actual conduct of human life one's all the time got to notice motives and to to try to control them um to um um and it's not um a fantasy an extra of scientists soon it's part of what what happens as you try to understand the motives of Napoleon uh uh what he did you will have to understand not just what he succeeded in doing but what he was trying to do and what view vision of life he had as a whole which he made to seem alright there seems to me a pretty important and I mean one thing that quite interested me about RM Hare is he dead by the way good I because I want to say something I wouldn't say if I wasn't sure that um he had um lived through the prisoner in the prisoner in junkies yes he had had a horrible time and it appears that during that time he had been um working on Philosophy and then he put it all out afterwards now it seems to me that if you were able to do that and it was a very impressive thing to do but philosophy that you're working on his life would have become very simple which is what I'm saying that prescriptivism which I ended up with um was over simple um and it was successful because it was over simple because people could pick up this little purple book and uh wouldn't ask themselves what is morality and um  they would think they know uh it was sort of final and this is very often happens to people who want to put forth philosophy uh yes have I said something sensical yes I mean what Sokrates said unexamined life is unliveable to man yeah well that seems to me to be the point yes um if you don't try to look at life as whole or even at your own life you've gotta look at awful lot at diff- diff- different directions you've got to um get a panorama haven't you um and cause habit which was going on in the Oxford discussions of finding one particular word um and saying here it's much more uh never doubtful that you thought and you know ambiguities beyond ambiguities well I knew they might sometimes be needed but mostly you shouldn't be doing that well I feel that not this is due to something badly wrong with the age that before asking themselves is a profit to be made about it this year you know is is the money coming out of this and and of course this is seldom true um in philosophy um but I mean on top of that when it has been petty and uh detailed like this people don't see the point of it um even if they might be prepared to uh put in an extra thousand or two they don't want to do so if it's off-putting I I really feel ignorant about the way things have been going in the world because I've been running out of the world sometime um but the way in which a subject prosperous is party that students are willing to do it now in fact I think students are still really willing to never just do philosophy they come in or don't they because they feel puzzled and they don't know what's important and which way to go so to speak um but they sort of philosophy that's going on has to be the kind that people can see the point of South American called Sandell yes well I think he's smashing I heard hime when he came here and he seemed extremely good at putting out the questions which everybody was interested in hearing what the  audience says and then remembering them afterwards
