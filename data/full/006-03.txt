I think for the for the most part we we have a lot of fun all right so everybody excited when you work hard and practice the games can be even more enjoyable but there's some days it's not fun you know whether it's uh I come in and decide I'm not gonna let it be fun today and I’m gonna do it I'm gonna test them I'm gonna see uh I'm gonna see how much they got in them and how hard they're willing to work and persevere through a very very demanding practice your lack of mental toughness right now is a glaring we gotta be better than that that’s unacceptable that's all part of of just testing what they have in their head in their heart and what they're willing to give on the court well to be honest with you Courtney it doesn't change it doesn't matter if we’re young if we have a veteran team it's all about bringing to the court every day great intensity our willingness to to learn a a competitive drive that can be contagious I mean I I think I have to bring that as as a coach and we have to do that as a coaching st- staff well I think um in general my style is is teaching I look at this as as the classroom every day where I want them to all be a students by the time we get into uh SEC competition look I see two people let's reverse the ball we don't return the ball over so you got to think about creating an environment where we have an advantage as I come in everyday you know practice preparation is important um that's where the staff really comes in because it’s it's not just what could summit want that's what every person on our staff expects and demands and I think we all have to have to have that in order to get the best results on a daily basis I think my look is is all about intensity um when I'm not satisfied with something you may you may see me give someone the look um I don't have any trouble doing it but it's all about trying to uh to be able to get them to focus at a at a different level or um sprint um whatever it might be the intensity and effort she bring every day is critical to our success as well as your individual success pay attention please pay attention you can learn a lot when you just pay attention that drives me nuts you know Courtney I don't think I get as nervous um while I put a lot of pressure on myself umI think I have more composure now I'm not as over anxious um before games maybe it's because I've been through so many games that I have just a better handle on it when I get in that huddle it's it's all about them it's all about the players and living in the moment and knowing what to say or hoping I said the right thing and encouraging them because they want it people that put on uniforms and compete want to be successful and maybe all they need from the coaches are give me some direction coach and give me the confidence at times give me the courage just give me the go ahead it's okay
