I didn't start out as as a star I started out in small roles very small roles when I was very very young until I uh well but I guess you see I didn't become a star overnight it was a gradual thing I had a lot of background behind me but I did find one picture very uh well nostalgic one that I look back upon Gilda and as a matter of fact it reminds me of it well it brings back a memory of the first film festival I had ever attended and that was in um Brussels uh in 19 uh I think it was 48 or 7 summer of nineteen forty-seven and uh the people in in at Brussels had seen uh this picture I had done Gilda and they didn't call me Rita they called me Gilda and a I have very pleasant and warm um remembrance of that um that visit to the film festival because I was greeted most enthusiastically well professionally but I had been steady since I was about five years old uh classic dancing and Spanish dancing which was a classic Spanish I was um um  dancing with my father who was my teacher of dancing and his father taught him I was a third generation at the time I was at the time I was 13 I was dancing professionally I mean for a living and after that um I was dancing in a place in Mexico with my father and um some people from Fox Studios saw me dancing and asked my father if I could come up and dance in the picture for them so he said yes and he of course he went with me and I danced in this film with Spencer Tracy the picture with Spencer Tracy did a great wonderful actor and um I only  danced in it a very small part and after that they asked my father if he would mind if they made a screen test of me and cause they because I was a you know under-aged naturally and my father and mother were always with me and um he said well that’s yes if well would you like to he asked me I said yes and so I did and I was put under contract to that studio well yes ah I um certainly have known what it was and it it was helpful to me um for a long time and then after a certain time it became really a hindrance you know kind of for my career because I was made um as an image of a certain kind of of um you know that particular thing that they do when they make it star they they're like the you know I don't want to be Gilda all my life I mean I I I feel I am an actress and I have talent and I can be I can do many many other parts such as the one I just finished in this picture that Terrance Young directed with Tony Quinn and um Rosana Skifa- Scafeina  it’s another kind of thing and and but but you see I I started to break away from that st- star system when my contract was up with that particular studio I was there for 18 years since I was a child and so that when that contract was up then I I went out of my own I was able to choose my own um roles my own parts and fortunately some very good ones came along like Separate Tables with Deborah Card Burt Lancaster David Niven and um you know wonderful and I had a great role in it and that started that changed my my pace you know
