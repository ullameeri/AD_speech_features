well done good for you indeed I do bad guys take notice well if you really need a weapon for self-defence you need it loaded because uh the Second Amendment gives me the right to have it loaded I would say it's a comfort factor you know not to worry about anything and I'm not really but uh I'm exercising one of the Rights uh passed on down to me from those wise old dead white guys that invented this country if it was good enough for them it's good enough for me I choose to have it there won't be very long I think American history is uh has a lot of blood on its hands no I don't think I don’t think as much ah they do yes well it’s an interesting point which can be redo um explored and you're good to explore it uh at Great Lengths but I think uh that's about all I have to say on well we have probably um a more mixed ethnicity than other countries some other countries no I don't it’s I wouldn't go so far as to say that we have enough trouble are we had enough problems with civil rights in the beginning and it's uh but I I have no no answer you said how is it that so so so many American uh kill each other I don't know that that's true but uh you the only answer I can give you is the one I already gave you which is that we have a history of violence perhaps more than most countries not more than Russia not more than Japan or not more than Germany but more than certainly more than Canada so did the vice president actually I wasn't aware of that at the time we came we came into the early morning uh rally and went on to wherever we were going would I have cancelled the uh I don’t it’s I don’t know I have no idea you want me to apologise me to apologise to the people in Flint well I’m afraid we don’t agree on on that there you go there's my girl I probably will be afraid to when it gets uh closer but I don't feel those things but she case she she got over it very quickly it was matter of moments almost before she said okay we'll go ahead from here I couldn't be me without her I'll tell you that I couldn't begin to be me without her yes of course I am you're the center of my life yes I'm afraid that's true how long and how well I can sustain my condition as it as it is now and when it stops being man my life will change beyond a certain point my life will be over but I know that it was the first call we had I wish no it's it's not going to go away but even you have to take the take it as it comes do the best with your life you can and what can't be cured must be endured if somebody said
