I think your work deals with uh inner landscapes of landscapes that um they they're subjective and we we all have our own um inner versions of of um translations extrapolations from the um from extant landscape in LA I heard that mr. T bought a house over in Beverly Hills he chainsawed old palm trees down right away and I I think um to talk about um transformation and um in respect and response to respect for in response to an extinct existing landscape I think that was the best Landscape Architecture move I've heard of in LA lately because I think that um LA is a botanical garden of uh you know it's another kind of imagine in your landscape it's nothing to do with with origins very LA basin origins which were about chaparral you know sycamores and washes and um occasional cottonwoods the um so but then it as in your uh eloquent collages I mean your there's it's all up for grabs there's there's a anybody's take is is uh arguable and and and at the same time believable there there's no uh me the datum that that um the non-datum that exists here throws it all out for grabs I think a mr. T should get the ASL award well you should take a a John Cage book along and and I mean it's a I don't know if I said two days it's it's a it's a timeless connection and it can be in a flash or it can be camping out forever I mean it I don't think it has to do with uh physical time spent on site I carry sights around with me on airplanes in my feelings at work on tray tables and airplanes and you know I don't think it's a question of time at all it's a question of intensity and willingness to surrender to place that is actual in place imagined two hours is plenty don't worry about it want to talk about that  um I think the um let's talk about the Venice house the the uh perce- there it's about perceptual influences the uh isolating the prospectival trick or whatever it is is is um artificial because it's really a lot of things at once there there are some subliminal relationships to um to that collapse spatial collapse that perspective can do the uh tactile the surfaces engage um spaces without the house that's outside the house the um there's a simultaneity of um of that of all those of all those things this the seal in section there's a section on mood where the ceiling slopes away that is also a subliminal collapse you know that nobody has to know that all this is happening yet I think people of responses I've heard is that they feel connected to the see they hear the this the sound of the sea is and he's particularly intensified when the pivot window opens and the their acoustic reflections that happen as it's in motion and you can it can be fixed in different positions so it's an its it isn't all at once you can thing and you can't isolate um any kind of rigor within that or pattern within it that's it's it's definitely about simultaneity well I live and work in Venice I'm I know all about it well I think it can ha- ha- happen in very subtle levels and very crass levels and in LA in LA the only project I've done this build is the house and it's um it’s if there's a percentage it's more it's sort of a bit sort of 90 percent toward Asia and 10% back toward LA and it it aspires to points beyond the shore and it is intended to to take the participant on a journey out of LA and beyond and the acknowledgement of um temporality of LA and the um glitz of LA is a is a is a very minor thing and that's that sort of heavy-handed symbolism I guess in terms of of quieter um secondary and tertiary um absorptions I mean it's great to watch the LAX flight pattern because that's once removed connection to Asia and or any points beyond that you want to imagine and the house is a great viewing platform for that just as the sky theatre at Cal Poly is um I think you just have to keep your feelings and you know eyes and ears open in LA because it's there it's speaking to you all the time it's um it's very hard to be judgmental about it it's hard to decide what for me to what to filter out and what not to but I guess in terms of the horse's blinders configuration of that house that there I mean that's an attitude about filtering they're right yeah well I I want it there's a disclaimer that I want to mention first that these events like this or performance pieces they don’t have anything to do with architecture um you know out there they're they're part of an organism a culture of a cultural organism and in talking in being introduced as I don't know what I can't hear what it was working with mythic things or uh symbols I mean you know that's that's hanging around and I talk about it but the the work is the work I mean just if you felt scale discrepancies good or bad that's that's what it's about it's what you apprehended there um um in the flesh I don't um it's scale I don't I don’t know I don't ever think about scale much I I don't I think it eludes me I don't know much about scale or a composition in terms of um formal attitudes or methodologies but the scale is or it has a relationship its size has a relationship to the big place big mountains big plane big discernible chunks of program that very conveniently sorted themselves out in in the rather diagrammatically into the objects you see they can comprise that the building the the finer grain that one could associate with quote human-scale um I think is there if you you know it it kind of depends on your itineraries every building everything we experience has multiple itineraries there is uh in that birthday room the conical thing the Fibonacci series is described in coke bottle skylights that spiral up and around there's a a reduction of a scale there and intimacy and a connection to you might geometric order that's its didactic and overt and in almost corny the kaleidoscopic thing which is butyl Bleakley from point vantage points within is a a shattering of a of of a normal kind of view out of window a fragmentation of a an isolated fragmentation of sky mountains city so those uh I think those are attitudes about scale there are um little things and big things there’re blur- blurrier eyes that look at the building is more about big things stone the colour of the mountains in the distance literal a literal connection of red sandstone to valley of fire and and and um when I was working on that I was teaching a studio at the GSD and the class flew out from Harvard met me we did we we met in Las Vegas and the class this the class problem was called learning from the other Las Vegas and I was really obsessed with that of of a kind of a of a reciprocal of venturi take on Las Vegas and in that building and how the studio was conducted and what we were in looked at in the studio which included mostly things like Michael peiser's double negative 2 to over damn the section and the the materiality and tectonic qualities of the dam and not the um not the cultural component that interested venturi and that the building you know you know course way deals with those those that with the other Las Vegas deals with origins of place and the way water is used but it it is subliminal and not doesn't hit you hit you over the head so I don’t those things this discussion this monologue is about I guess could be about scale I mean a scale of experience scale of object I I I think I know what looks good to me and I manipulate things in models and in drawings and I I built a lot of things so I know how they look when they're built I mean I know how certain spaces feel and I rely on that very heavily I don't reinvent out that each time out I mean it's an instinct there's things go along with the white hair hopefully I mean and that's much more interesting than uh trying to do it it's like the concept of Duende in in flamenco it's it visits the one day visits a site where a flamenco performance may be occurring and and as either shows up or a doesn't you you can't look for it you can't make it happen it yet either shows up or not and Garcia lorca has wrote a great essay dealing with that in um 1928 essay the idea of the of how elusive it is and Henry Miller talked about in a great way in the Colossus of Marisa the his sort of Greek travelogue it wasn't one of his dirty books it exists great travel a travelogue and talked about a lot at the state of a life aliveness and emptiness that he uh wanted to dwell in as an artist and that state of readiness for me is allows to one day to enter I mean it makes the possibility exist and you don't you don't try for it you don't try you don't say oh I'm going to be something I'm going to you know get into simultaneity because that's a you know that's a an ambush that you've set up for yourself
