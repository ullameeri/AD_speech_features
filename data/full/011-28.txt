yeah I think it's probably commitments other places you know touring everywhere else and uh they got it at the beginning of the year usually around this time the even rest of the world it's quiet so you know they got us first bicentennial incentive sounds a bit sexual with AC/DC bi um no it’s nothing for us it was just a the right time in fact I didn't know until I got here that it was a Bicentennial um it depends some sometimes you can get here like last year I got here twice um but before that one in 3 years uh so if ever I can get here I try to get here yeah still the best city well for me because I grew up in Sydney so know me way about about one of the best cities in the world for me yeah yeah you know a lot of uh people from Sydney would probably deny it but yeah for me it's it’s pretty much well I think people want they value these days I mean they're paying big money to see a rock show I mean you've gotta give me the the value or whatever maybe I I've never liked things done on the cheap you know if you if I think if you get to a stage I think people really expected of them I mean it's great to be able to walk in this more place it's more building just play but I mean just something but I think when people are paying um good money for something they want to see something for that money and when the boredom I can wear everything anything that was going you know a gorilla suits anything you know but it was all all for the same thing you know make people look and see what's going on I remember Bon Scott climbing all over the Horde and the vilian on a spider web one night and and we wouldn't get him down  well that schoolboy always which for me was always it helped me you know because it when I put on the suit I could hop on stage and it gives me a bit of confidence you know yeah it doesn't it just as soon as it goes on you get this impish feeling in the cinders I've got the suit on nothing can go wrong so it's always for me a bit of confidence jailbreak uh around the world which was like to be rock that opened the door for us and as soon as that album came out and that's probably one of my favourite albums um I like Highway To Hell very much Back In Black you know all those and I like the new one very much uh for us it was always we were probably a band it's best seen in a live situation you know and um that's how the title came about it was it's not to be taken like go on blow up your video it was it's more um how do you say um instead of cause everything's automatic these days a kid can flick on the button on the TV and he's got a you know remote control you can zoom for everything and get it coming in from all over the world you know you can turn on your radio and get rock coming in from America so for us for us the best thing as a band it was always we were great on stage you know hard living hard drinking oh yeah I can’t say anything my mistress inside there uh uh I think a lot of it uh get bored certainly when I started there was a lot of uh stuff floating around you know and um every time I used to go into America I had every dope dealer in the world waiting backstage for me you know but me I really I I I drink tea and and at that time I used to to drink milk in chocolate you know I used to get uh dope dope squad people coming up to me and saying uh what's the little guy on you know and I would say it you know I eat chocolate bars so they were running around with these little chemical kits trying to find out what this new drug was chocolate and so but I I think a lot of it's just over the years I mean the band itself they like to drink you know um it's a few fish among them you know uh yeah well we for us when we started and people would say well what are you doing you you were playing rock and rock and roll music you know and um to get through I mean it was a bit louder than most you know and we were always we were never conscious of what uh the people really thought of us we just went out there to play you know and we found that long ago the best thing that we we done on stage was rock music you know knew how to rock and uh that's for us all of this if anything it's probably hard rock if it's not we've been called punk uh I think in in Brittany's to call it New Wave America was always looking for a good tag for us uh but I think we were a far away from the heavy metal thing you know because that seems to have a you know they're all quite similar a lot of these bands you know  they've all got any sort o uh sorry I’m bumping the micy ever got these pre client footsteps and stuff you know uh you know and they’ve always got the guy the blonde drive going and the drummer then smiles at the camera so for us we we we were always been um you know we can only be ourselves you know I mean that's how we are I mean we could never really pose we were not a a posy sort of a band you know oh yeah I think they're all safe my pleasure Richard
