well I think the first moment was when we hired coach DeMoss back in the spring when we brought her onboard I thought you know we're gonna win the championship she sure did it's amazing it is seems like bout 40 but yeah I said I didn't have you I think really the first time we knew we had a chance was after the Olympic break and we came back better uh Tamika Catchings came back with her third gold medal and uh the players that weren't in the Olympics had worked hard and gotten better and uh uh I just felt like there was a different chemistry there and then we just kind of took off and nobody picked us to beat Atlanta uh moment of silence for the Atlanta dream nobody picked us to beat Connecticut and uh certainly nobody picked us to beat Minnesota with three uh Olympians and so it was just a great uh it was a great season well we really weren't ready for that game you know I think we thought it was the next day so you know we started off with our foot in the hole uh but then we regrouped and came back here well now that's one of the plays that we work on at the end of every practice okay DeMoss called it called it a Fever for fanatic and we dive and whoever's closest gets to get that shot we just changed the name but that shot better go let’s not forget the second game where Cheryl lost her jacket you know she wasn't happy with the officials but I wasn't either and I didn't have on a jacket so I learned a lesson that night right well I couldn't I I normally have a jacket but when she threw that jacket and then the officials started calling every call their way I thought boy I'm wearing a jacket from now on well I was real disappointed in her behaviour I thought no wait a minute I'm an older coach I should have the first choice to throw that jacket and so we bantered about that but you know Cheryl is a fantastic coach oh my goodness gracious has done a tremendous job with Minnesota and uh with her talent and it was all in fun really was if I did that then why is my tail so big you don’t usually catch me off guard you got me today I really love the RV on top
