exasperation um with the the doctrine going around for some time largely from scientists but also having trade from some philosophers uh that the self is an illusion that you aren't really there uh as Crick said you your joys and sorrows your ambitions and memories and so on are just a lot of this uh ourselves in you man well now the trouble with this sort of talk it does seem to me very serious that it distracts people from thinking about their own lives in the direct way that they can from the later that they themselves are getting it tells them know what you really need is some physical science or other in the present its these nerve cells this distraction this notion that science ahead of everything else will solve all your problems What one called scientism uh is has been on the increase for a long time and I think it takes the place which perhaps some sorts of theology used to take getting in the way of people thinking about what is directly rather than sho- they should thinking about yeah I would be happy to start by doing that by talking about London taxi drivers uh you know some experiments done some years ago when the taxi drivers really did have to learn the whole of London my heart found that the hippocampus were bigger than other people's well you see he become what we remember with and it's a good test because the names of streets don't mean anything so it's pure memory um and it emerged that these people by learning this sort of stuff permanently affecting the brain cells you see the thing that's so hard to get the hang of here I think is that when we think one thing is happening but we perceive it in two ways we perceive it directly in consciousness but it could also be perceived by people measuring the cells the cells are doing something when we think um these aren't two separate things it's part of its it really is of the moment the one thing um and the the doctrine that matter affects mind and mind can't affect matter has been really very strong in our culture for the last more than century um so that it makes it very hard to understand and uh you see the that's only the taxi drivers but there is a lot of what they call biofeedback can be discovered if I read New Scientist I often come across some gadget or other which people are going to be controlling by thinking they can control their blood pressure you see you looking at the graph to see where it's going they can't make that blood pressure go down well this isn't the sort of thing which ought to happen according to uh the ideas which we were I mean largely brought up on but it does well you see yes because that uh line of propaganda uh certainly suggested that what we think of as ourselves our joys and sorrows and so on uh doesn't have any effect uh it's all being done by the genes the genes love us about four years ago wasn't it now it's much more the brain cells but the story have same bad effect that people who have got to take decision and think about are they going to live are being told it won't make any difference really it's all just froth on the top uh this is whatever it's fatalism you see fatalism of a rather new kind fatalism used to involve saying there's something called faith which is after you but now it involves saying there are various gadgets inside you which are taking charge and rather mysteriously they become active selves uh you yourself used to be one and we thought the point of that was to say that nobody could be an active self but somehow these little things pop up as substitute subjects well you might well ask I mean there's an awful lot of this kind of thing around people are suddenly told that there's a scientific explanation for something which they had assumed all along now one thing that might be interesting about this is simply the idea that the scientists are observing it from another angle but what they are obviously these people obviously thinking is the real cause is is in is in this and this distracts people from attending what to what they should be attending to when they think about right and left thinking for what is the difference in their thoughts in their lives in their feelings in the course of action that they'll take uh the direct observation of the relevant goings-on uh is pushed aside because the idea is we've now got the scientific explanation and that idea of the scientific explanation don't seem to be a superstition really of the kind that should be much more often denounced than it is and then the whole tone of that book of Crick's which I've been quoting from about you yourself your joys and sorrows and so on is this very snooty uh I'm a scientist and you're not uh nine uh which makes people feel oh no well I'm not am I you know uh and what is often bad science and always irrelevant is pushed forward as being the true explanation now this is very interesting I think there are parts of the whole thing same thing you see if you start seriously saying my subjective feelings and so on aren't real what you're left with you're left with an abstract observer aren't you um you're supposed to be because you're talking all the science you see you're supposed to be a cognitive object something that knows knows things but not connected to the things that you know I mean all this about human destiny and so on it's out in the world it's one of the things that you might know but you the never are not part of it now if you're not part of it you see it's not gonna matter to you very much if the whole planet gets destroyed uh you see you are not you're not vulnerable uh you're not related to uh the other creatures and people who are going to suffer uh you're outside it and I think see that in this notion of what it is to be scientific which has been really very strongly propaganded for a long time the idea is that you should be detached you see that you shouldn't be identifying with anything that you uh are looking at that you you should the your pulse should not alter as it were because you are now this abstract observer you're detached so none of it matters of course there is a physical basis of course if somebody knocks you on the head you can't go on thinking this is not in question but that is not the whole thing the idea that because your thoughts and feelings are dependent on these brain cells and such they aren't real is a meaningless thought people get the idea that nothing's real unless it's physical meaning unless it can be checked its existence can be checked by some physical science you are just providing me with evidence of how extraordinarily habitual this rather mindless materialism exclusive materialism is today people think it's obvious that nothing except physical things are real we'll just watch how they live for the next day or so uh you see people say there is nothing in the world except these uh physical objects well among the things that there are in the world is money right money is not just bits of paper and coins money is an immensely complex system which is great great reality it's really enough it gets in our way social realities are what we largely live by um and if you say well behind those social realities uh there have to be some physical things that is if you take away the money the person won't be able to eat so much or something of this sort no I thought that was quite an interesting example I mean Napoleon does make these two rather startling invasions you see it really is his own idea um did his neurons go out into the world and work out yes it should be Russia next you see where would the neurons get all that the neurons cannot be the source of ideas like that which are socially very large and report facts about the world we are much more complicated beings than this notion  this is a general point about mental illness or now called mental illness isn't it it has two aspects it really does the quote subjective medical uh aspect in which you can look it all up in various literatures uh and the personal aspect the person the the what it is for the person themselves and for all those around them now we don't have to choose between these then we often do in practice have to decide which to emphasize um but it is one of the serious worries from the present day that these are both strong ways of thinking uh which have somehow to be brought together and uh good psychiatrists and good nurses and so on are always going around from one side to the other and saying have I forgotten something you see but this isn't the only place in life where different ways of thinking have both to be used it's quite a lot of it about um and it's one thing that I think is it the job of philosophers to draw attention to when people get started by being obsessed with a single way of looking at things they will just get that a telescope rather than the microscope stander can see what the neighbours of this are you know thank you for bringing it up it's absolutely central example yeah well I'm sorry this is a depressing subject uh a lot of philosophy teachings all right but there has been an increasingly strong tendency in the last half century or so to narrow the questions to uh think it's more professional to uh get a more detailed question uh and not uh mention the wider aspects of it I take I think a lot of the trouble here is due to the custom of uh graduate students having to do a thesis which they have to defend they have to choose a subject which is not too big they've got to try and avoid saying anything obviously wrong so they are defensive they narrow it and they get themselves a speciality they become the person who uh wrote about Russell's theory of this and that and inevitably
as a result of that they get unwilling and afraid to look at logic questions they do tend to view it as un- unprofessional to do so and if you brought back from the grave uh you see even quite uh the skeptical people like Hugh they would be shocked I think at this sort of syllabuses they would find uh it it's not the detailed working and important it is but that you should direct yourself by looking for what's the largest question that seems to be making differences here that you should look for a make a wider map can on which that showed in the context of everything else uh seems to me to be a crucial habit and I don't know how to get it back I'm afraid into present day philosophy teaching
