good morning my name is Maxine Waters uh congresswoman from the 29th congressional district in Los Angeles uh the scene of the early fires that you witness uh on national television last night with me are members of the Congressional Black Caucus and a representative from the NAACP and we're here this morning to express our outrage and our extreme concern about the unfair verdict uh in the case of Rodney King uh last evening in Simi Valley uh each of the members here will have an opportunity uh to make a statement uh expressing their feelings and their concerns allow me to start this press conference by telling you that I am angry I am outraged I think there has been a miscarriage of justice and I suppose I should have known once there was a change of venue and that child was moved to basically an all-white community a community where over 2,000 Los Angeles police officers reside that the chances for justice were going to be slim but I suppose I was uh foolish enough to believe that given the very graphic depiction of the beating of Rodney King captured on video that uh there would be an undeniable assignment of responsibility to those who had in fact beat him uh unfortunately we saw a verdict that I have no problems in identifying as a racist verdict where the jurors in this case is trying to make us believe we have not seen what we have seen with the video I don't care how it is framed and what spin is attempt uh attempted uh and the description of that video by those doers the fact of the matter is we and America witness the brutal beating of Rodney King I feel there should have been convictions for all of them literally uh to uh be allowed to get away without a conviction and only one instance of perhaps a mistrial is a travesty uh today I and congressman Ford and Reverend Jackson met with attorney general Barr we first asked about the report and the investigation that they were supposed to have done as a result of the meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus after the Rodney King beating we were told that they in fact had done an investigation uh they still have not completed it it was national in scope and that that did not speak directly to the Rodney King beating they have been monitoring this case we have been told their team is in Los Angeles at this time and they are gathering the information by which to make a determination about whether or not they can prosecute they have to wait until after uh the trial had taken place in Los Angeles and now they are free to make a determination about whether to prosecute under the civil rights laws of this country they have two laws uh conspiracy to violate civil rights and violation of civil rights uh statues that they can prosecute under we urge them to prosecute and we urge them to move with all due speed with all due haste to do so I indicated that I thought that uh the situation not only in Los Angeles is very volatile and it is not going to subside easily but I still think there's an opportunity this weekend for it to spill over into other communities in this country we try to urge them uh to move not only quickly but to understand the danger that we're confronted with as I stand here nine people are dead my last count last this morning before I tried to get some sleep was over 50 something fires raging all over Los Angeles the fire started in my district and one of the largest was right around the corner from my house uh there are scores of injuries and still anger and frustration and people who plan on staying on the streets and expressing their outrage and anger in any way they deem necessary there are those who would like for me and others in all of us to tell people to go inside to be peaceful that they have to accept the verdict I accept the responsibility of asking people not to endanger their lives I am NOT asking people not to be angry I am angry and I have a right to that anger and the people out there have a right to that anger we don't want anybody killed none of us believe in violence but there's some angry people in America and young black males in my district are feeling at this moment if they could not get a conviction with the Rodney King video available to the jurors that there can be no justice in America I would ask the individual members of the Black Caucus to step forward and share their concerns with you at this moment uh please president Bush does not talk to us uh let's let's let's let's be straight about this we have no access to the White House we had one meeting since I have been in Congress what the President did was Performa it was courtesy but there is no relationship and he has not been in contact with us we do not enjoy uh the kind of relationship that would allow elected members of this Congress to be in touch with the White House  well let me just tell you I think that immediately we need an indication from the President of the United States that he's encouraging his Justice Department to prosecute we need some leadership from the highest level for president that does not normally pay very much attention to domestic matters we're asking him to be uncharacteristic and do so in this case we're asking him to use leadership to say to this nation that he believes there has been injustice and we're asking him to speak directly to the young black males and tell them that their lives are valued in this country we want some leadership we want the Justice Department to prosecute we want them to move with all due haste perhaps that will help stem the tide of violence in addition to that we really do need to look at further how we can have laws in this country that will supersede some of these jurisdictions that in fact are racist and backwards and some other kinds of things who fail to prosecute officers who violate uh human beings and who abuse them and uh violate them so we need to do all of these things we need to organize and work with our communities to say that we need to put measures on the ballot in some of these local communities we need to strengthen our ability to vote and to override the City Council's many of whom are racists who do not act on our behalf we're not going to stop working I have been fighting Daryl Gates for 14 years I call for his resignation after the killing of Eula Love a young black woman who was shot down on her porch about a twenty nine dollar gas bill this man has been a lightning rod his siege mentality has permeated the Los Angeles Police Department he has to accept responsibility in the actions of those officers officers don't act that way if they think something is going to happen to them if they think they're going to be disciplined what are we going to do everything make no mistake we as members of elected members of Congress leaders in our communities cannot satisfy America that we can say something to do something and have credibility that will keep people quiet and I'm not going to lead anybody to believe that I have that power and influence given given what has just taken place what has taken place is this jury has said to America to the leadership to everybody there's something in this system that allows a change-of-venue basically an all-white jury to tell you you have not seen what you saw and that despite the fact that there is a video we can come together and decide that there should be no convictions that there is no guilt in this matter so to ask us to say to young people have faith in the system at this particular point in time is very difficult I think I have more credibility and want to maintain more credibility than that what I'm saying to the Justice Department and to the president is you can be helpful because you are the people who have a lot of power in these matters the president has the power of leadership the Justice Department has the power beyond what has been done to prosecute under the civil rights laws you get on television you meet with mayors and leaders around this country and assure them that you're going to take this matter up what Barr said to us the Attorney General was they have to wait until after the local jurisdiction has made its decision that took place last night now they have the possibility of entering in order to enter they have to do a number of things in the collection of the data and the subpoena and what have you they assured us they understood the warning that we were giving them that this country was at risk and they would move with all due haste what would satisfy me as if he could have said to me today okay they have completed their work I've read it now to prosecute but he cannot give me an insurance that it would be done in the next 24-48 hours all he could give me is that he would move in all due haste there's not just a hysteria about crime there's institutionalized racism in the criminal justice system the disproportionate numbers of black males that are in prisons around this country are in prisons because they don't have the wealth by which to get fancy lawyers who will go in and ensure that they buy justice for them as white folks can do in America that's why black males are imprisoned prisoned disproportionately beyond that over the past twelve years we have had signals from on high at the highest levels of government with the Reagan and Bush administration that with a wink and a nod tells people it's all right to be against affirmative action it's all right uh to be racist in fact let me just tell you David Duke did not rise in a vacuum the polarization and the politics of separation and division that have taken place ie the Willie Horton campaign ie other kinds of things similar to that a Justice Department that's entered in certain kinds of cases has helped to create an environment of separation and division when you hear the jurors talk about someone who caused this beating himself when you hear them talk about they could have stopped it as was mentioned before when they hear them describe this menacing black man who was big and strong and one officer talked about his grunts like an animal you're talking about racism you're talking about the kind of racism that would lead a jury to say this man is less than human and he got what he deserved and that was all right you're really talking about and I don't want us to get away from it we can't get away from this terrible ugly description of institutionalized racism because until we confront it in America and understand that we have to have an appreciation for diversity and leadership that helps people come together and learn to live with each other we'll miss the point all right we're going to wrap this up this is the last question going back this afternoon uh I will be on the street uh I will be talking with young people I encourage protest I encourage sensible protests I will try and and uh make sure that we tell people they must avoid violence but I encourage protests I think we cannot allow this decision to go in silence I will be back working with my community working with young people continuing to have all of the community understand they must impress upon the Justice Department and the president that they've got to vote for prosecution in this matter that will be helpful uh and everything else that we can do thank you very much
