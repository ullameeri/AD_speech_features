yes it a boy rhyme is write me another town song uh we were doing uh another one of his songs at the time and he was in the studio he went out he went in um the the in the booth not in the booth but in um the control room and he sat there and wrote Wichita Lineman and he had the idea in his head because when he was back in Oklahoma he saw a highline guy on the wire fixing you know the highline of the the vectors Electrical Wars you know phone wires and Wichita Lineman that's that’s where Jimmy got the idea for that song and he said yeah and he wrote it in 20 minutes maybe and Wichita Lineman became the most played song of the millennium because there was probably god you know 15 different records of it Jimmy Webb's chord progressions are the best um that I believe that I've ever heard he in um um I think I think it's the same thing with a lot a lot of great writers they they just put they put their stamp on something I mean wow how can you conceive MacArthur Park uh and I heard I heard them doing the the the orchestra on that they did it all at one time in the big studio United uh and they just did the track of MacArthur Park and it was just awesome and then Jimmy flew Jimmy Webb flew to London England and put Richard Harrison yeah Richard Richard wasn’t it uh put his voice on and that was and then she brought it back and then put the blossoms on under that to do the oh knows oh what an incredible genius stroke uh it's probably the best the most played long song in the history of music I lived in Arkansas and uh what was it Horace Greeley said go west young man so I I I really like it out there uh we went uh just drove an old car in first time my old fifty no it was uh fif— uh uh 42 mercury coupe I'll never forget that little car uh and when I got into the session work in LA Jimmy Bowling and I a Jimmy was a great producer strangers in the night and all that stuff he he’d run Sinatra's company and uh it was amazing I when I sat with the friend of mine he was looking to get into some kind of music indie whether or movie indie whether or anything and there was a drummer named Earl Palmer he he's the session drummer I did a lot of sessions with later but he kind of took me under his thumb I don't know I don't you know I don't remember how it came about but I went into saw some stuff he was doing a session and invited me to come down I sat there and watched it and I said that's what I want to be that's what I want to do you know and the word got around about 1962 when turn around look at me come out Jimmy Bolin and I would do demo sessions for song for for publishing companies and uh we'd you know give them to artists to see if they want to play or producers if they want to play and that's that's that's how I cut into the studio work because they say who played guitar Glen Campbell who's singing Glen Campbell who's playing the High Park Glen Campbell because I'd overdone everything  we had to ping-pong it and it just it was just Jimmy and I you know and we go on and we got $10 a song man I mean we could make 60 70 bucks a day man on that and that was I was it was so much it was such a learning experience for me I think the biggest time I had in in my life so far is for us you know o- other than children of course uh would be doing the sessions with the guys you know uh I it was a thrill to to be up there in yours you know play guitar with Dean Martin you know and and say and then go up and sing harmony with him and stuff and Sinatra strangers in the night was just so that was a topper of all time I think to get to play with Sinatra I've always been the big fan of uh Nat King Cole and sit there and play rhythm guitar and watch him sing those the artists like him we said we would rehearse a song probably five or six times before they would come in the studio and so they can so we don't mess up you know or find any any any bugs or ticks or whatever in there and the arrangement itself and two or three takes would was it Sinatra strangers in the night was three takes bingo you get paid for a full session which was about a hundred bucks then it was it was a lot of fun I'd played on the Beach Boys’ sessions new in fact I had sang sang with them in the group too and uh when Brian got his feet in the sand was going to write the Pet Sounds album uh Michael of asked me said can you own the road and and do Brian’s part and I said wow I bet I can play bass but I'm not a bass player uh but I said for that kind of money eh eh eh yeah I said oh I said yeah I'd love to you know but the hardest thing for me was to and to play bass like that sing cause I'm usually do something else with guitarI probably got to play the bass like it and it it it worked out but we didn't have to worry about singing that's what I loved about doing the sessions of Beach Boys you don’t have to worry about singing and playing at the same time we did we got the track and then we got around the microphone and sang and that was that’s what made it so easy TV show Don Ho was uh on the show and he he said Glenn here I I recorded a Jimmy Webb song and it didn't do nothing for me and I said which one and he and so and he s—he I put his record of it out  oh hey and he he he had he the song like only at lower key and I thought he never wasn't going to get through the song before you know but what a great song that is but I’m I’m so glad Don Ho pitched me the song I said and I I I had got I learned the song off of Don Ho’s forty five days ahead of it it sure got tiring inner ring they because I've been used to just going into the studios and  playing you know at all and here you already going through everywhere and I mean literally all over the world and and including you know Vietnam uh everything uh that I do it was a good history education I'll put it that way but I really didn't like touring over there that much it was you know you don't speak a language uh the audiences were were good they were fine but it was just something about it and here on and here lately uh uh has come up that I want to do a a show in China will do like three or four shows in China and I wanna I want to see how that works out it was controlled mayhem I guess you would call it the the did to do the TV show in the first place I mean I was I was like this on the first night it was uh but Tommy Smothers said don't worry we go out and and just come out like you do when you’re when we're talking you know on the sofa or something he said just come out and do that say it's the way you say it don't you know you don't try to say it the way anybody else does and Tommy actually really gave me a a a lot of good schooling on what to do in front of the camera Rob Reiner and uh Steve Martin were writers on the show and uh it was amazing they they wrote some of the most i- incredible stuff things that CBS sensors wasn’t okay it because it was a little bit a little bit on the right I think and a conservative left I'll put it that way and uh I didn’t I couldn't understand why was it just wow they were just good writers oh Linda Ronstadt she was she dressed the way she wanted to dress she didn't she didn’t want the wardrobe to dress her and she didn't wear any shoes some reason nor socks I don't think maybe she did wear socks cause the studio's was pretty cold but I don't know I didn't think I just let this play the way she would have dressed and what she wanted to wear uh she was one of those one-of-a-kind women just great talent great singer but uh I don't know yeah it's singing with her was the pleasure my first memory of Cher was being with Sonny Bono at at the recording studios and uh then she started uh singing background there uh in group the you know the whoever it was I could she wasn't that she's not a usual talent incredible incredible singer and singer uh and singng with her it was really gasps I I hate to see her retire there's a chemistry there when I was working with with Cher and it was fun and she would look at me to give him that little smile you know like and we were singing it so good together uh she was just a great great talent she she ceased oh I'd I like what she's doing in Vegas I'd like to go see her again I was stickler about keys uh in other words I got I will evaluate a song or if that's the right word to uh what's a high and watch the low and uh I could get I would try - I favoured singing as high as I could more than I did as low as I could because it it just made a lot of sense to me then to do it like that because that's a comfortable key now if you did it up here capo time just move it on up the neck play the same thing uh I will hunt between something like that something that's level on the bottom part and without went being too winded or too low and same thing with the highs I I I get a song delivered in three or four different keys see which is the low which is high and then fitted in between it I never was much of a writer I'm a I’m song doctor and I’m I’m that uh when I used to do you know little Jimmy Dickens slave it is full of bad as a certain uh Simic I just drive ripped I like the song I would take it and and then do it the way I would say it so it wouldn't be awkward to me because I had a lot of people you just sing it it it looks good on paper but it don't sing very well and I I guess one of the first thing that I noticed about my ears that they hear that and if it's awkward I understand what it is and I just smooth it up it's something that I don't know I wish I could give an illustration you know it just it make it making something awkward is a it's like somebody reading a music piece of music for the first time they're not sure of it I heard it on the on a album cut station in LA Rhinestone Cowboy wow uh almost wrecked my car because is that the song had that kind of thing on because wow wow wow who wrote that song Larry Weisse wrote it the guy that uh had the album out
